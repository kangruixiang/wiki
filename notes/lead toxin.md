DMSA (succimer) is an oral medication used to treat children with moderate  lead intoxication. It has a very low risk of toxicity.

Children with severe lead intoxication should be treated with parenteral dimercaprol and EDTA. Intravenous deferoxamine is the treatment of choice for serious iron overdoses.
