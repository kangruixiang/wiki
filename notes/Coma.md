# Workup

<!-- 4 evaluations of coma patients.. -->

- cerebrum: higher function but not critical
	- EEG to determine function
- brainstem: critical. Reflexes used:
	- corneal reflex: q tip
	- cold water calorics: COWS
		- cold water left ear: eyes move left slowly, then quick beating nyastagmus **opposite**
		- absent reflex: eyes move left slowly, no nyastagmus beating
		- brain dead: eyes don't move at all
	- Doll's eyes: move head, eyes fixed
- heart: keeps blood going for brain
	- EKG
- peripheral nerves: permits feel and see
	- physical exam

# Different Brain Function

<!-- normal, coma, vegetative state, brain death, locked in syndrome differences.. -->

|                             | Cerebrum  | Brainstem | Heart | Motor                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| Normal                      | +         | +         | +     | +                                      |
| Coma                        | depressed | +         | +     | +                                      |
| Persistent Vegetative State | -         | +         | +     | +                                      |
| Brain death                 | -         | -         | +     | -                                      |
| Locked in syndrome          | +         | +         | +     | Can feel, can't move except blink eyes |

- coma: can be reversible
	- hypoglycemia
	- narcoid induced
- PVS: still can have motor function that's part of brainstem (tracking with eyes, swallow)
- Brain death: really dead. Disconnect ventillator and if don't breath = dead. **Absence of brainstem reflex**
	- no EEG
	- loss of grey/white junction
- Locked in syndrome: pontine stroke. Looks like PVS but can move eyes and aware of surrounding
