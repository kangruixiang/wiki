# athlete's heart can look like HCM

- related: [[heart failure]]

This patient's ECG findings – high-voltage QRS complexes and lateral repolarization abnormalities (inverted T waves) – are consistent with **left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)**.  Young (age <35) athletes can develop a physiologic increase in left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and myocardial mass in response to intense cardiovascular training.  This physiologic condition, termed **athlete's heart**, can lead to findings of LVH on ECG in the absence of any cardiovascular pathology.  However, **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)**, the most common cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes in the United States, usually causes similar findings on ECG.  In addition, approximately 20% of patients with HCM present with episodes of presyncope.

Because absence of a systolic ejection murmur on physical examination does not rule out HCM, a young athlete such as this patient with ECG findings of LVH and **unexplained symptoms** (eg, chest pain, palpitations, presyncope, syncope) should be evaluated for HCM or other structural heart disease (eg, aortic stenosis) with **transthoracic echocardiography**.  Left ventricular wall thickness <15 mm, among other clinical characteristics, can help distinguish athlete's heart from HCM.
