- CT: cognitive behavior therapy
- No huge difference after failing first SSRI
- Paroxetine is most anxiolytic. Citalopram better tolerated and also has anxiolytic. Zoloft also has anxiolytic

## Switching antidepressants

- Cross titrate 2 different medications over 2 weeks

Pharmacologic treatment options for patients with **treatment-resistant depression** include switching to another antidepressant or augmenting with a second agent.  This patient has failed to respond to an adequate trial (>6 weeks) of high-dose fluoxetine.  Patients with little to no improvement **(nonresponders)** or unacceptable tolerability generally benefit from **switching to another antidepressant** rather than augmentation.  Discontinuing fluoxetine and starting venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, would be the most appropriate next step.

**Partial responders**, in contrast, can consider **augmentation** as a first-line option as switching carries a risk of losing the partial therapeutic benefit from the original drug.  Augmentation strategies include adding a second-generation antipsychotic, an antidepressant with a different mechanism of action, or occasionally lithium or triiodothyronine.

The second-generation antipsychotic aripiprazole is an effective augmentation strategy for treatment-resistant major depression.  However, it is not used as monotherapy.
