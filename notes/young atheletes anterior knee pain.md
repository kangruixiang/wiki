Prepatellar bursitis occurs with chronic irritation of the anterior knee.  Symptoms include pain with direct pressure and superficial swelling over the patella.

Patellar tendonitis is an overuse syndrome resulting from repetitive jumping or kicking.  Patients present with anterior knee pain after exercise.  Unlike Osgood-Schlatter disease, patients have point tenderness at the inferior pole of the patella.

The sartorius muscle is the longest muscle in the body.  It originates from the anterior iliac spine and inserts into the [pes anserinus]() of the anteromedial tibia shaft near the tibial tuberosity.  Pes anserinus bursitis commonly occurs in runners and causes anteromedial knee pain.

The tendon of the biceps femoris (part of the hamstrings) inserts at the styloid process of the head of the fibula.  The medial condyle of the tibia is the insertion site for the semimembranous muscle, the most medial of the hamstring muscles.  The hamstring muscles are involved in knee flexion and hip extension.
