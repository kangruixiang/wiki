# 03 Congenital Heart Disease

Initially in the presence of a ventricular septal defect, blood is shunted **from the left ventricle to the right ventricle**, resulting in increased pulmonary blood flow.

Pulmonary hypertension, caused by a ventricular septal defect, causes **hyperplasia of the tunica intima and hypertrophy of the tunica media leading to narrowing of the pulmonary artery.**

Longstanding ventricular septal defects, may produce an Eisenmenger complex, the \*\*reversal of the shunt from the normal left to right blood flow to right to left due to increased pulmonary resistance compared to systemic peripheral vascular resistance, \*\*leading to cyanosis from inadequate oxygenation.
