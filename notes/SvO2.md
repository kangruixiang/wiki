<!-- SvO2 use, high vs low -->

- mixed venous O2 saturation
- measures end O2 consumption and delivery
- must be obtained from pulmonary artery catheter or another central line device
- ScvO2 (central venous O2) useful surrogate and measured via CVC in SVC, measures venous blood from upper half of body
- normal 65-70%
- If low:
	- increased demand: hyperthemia, shiver, pain, seizure
	- decreased delivery: anemia, bleeding, dilution
	- **cardiogenic shock**
- if high (>0.8): high flow states, **sepsis**, hyperthyroidism, severe liver disease

- calculate cardiac output from SVO2 from Fick's equation
- CO > 4 or 5 is good
- CI > 2 is good
- Then, calculate SVR from CO
- SVO2 must be obtained from central access
- Renal perfusion pressure = MAP - CVP, must be > 60
