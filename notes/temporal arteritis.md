## Temporal Arteritis

<!-- ignore.. -->

Temporal (giant cell) arteritis is a **chronic vasculitis** that affects \*\*medium- and large-sized arteries \*\*with a proclivity for the **cranial branches of the arteries that originate from the aortic arch**.

It is characterized pathologically by the presence of **subacute granulomatous inflammation**.

The inflammation is **segmental**, with intervening segments of normal and inflamed vessel wall.

Temporal arteritis is more common in patients **over the age of 50**, and occurs more frequently in **women**.

Nearly half of the patients with temporal arteritis also have [[polymyalgia rheumatica]].

Symptoms of temporal arteritis include:

- **Severe headache of sudden onset**
- **Exquisite temporal tenderness**
- **Jaw pain with chewing** due to claudication
- **Scalp pain**
- **New monocular blindness**
- **Fever**
- \*\*Myalgias and arthralgia \*\*(may be due to polymyalgia rheumatica)

Without treatment, the **monocular blindness** of temporal arteritis can become permanent.

The gold standard for diagnosing temporal arteritis is **temporal artery biopsy**, though this should _never delay treatment_. Biopsy will demonstrate **granulomatous inflammation of the media and adventitia with a lymphocytic infiltrate**. Since the lesions are segmental, a relatively long (minimum 2 cm) segment of temporal artery is required for diagnosis. Note that a negative biopsy does not rule out the disease.

Patients with temporal arteritis will usually have a **markedly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)**. _Suspicion for temporal arteritis is often considered one of the only (if not the only) true indication for ordering an ESR because the gold standard for diagnosis (i.e. biopsy) is time-consuming, and an appropriately elevated ESR in a patient with the defining symptomatology has a high positive predictive value for a positive biopsy._

Physical examination will reveal a **prominent temporal artery** with **beading, tenderness to palpation, and diminished or absent pulse**.

Doppler ultrasound may show **stenosis** or **occlusion** of the involved artery, but is highly operator-dependent and should never replace biopsy as a means of making the diagnosis.

Fundoscopic examination in patients presenting with _acute visual loss_ secondary to temporal arteritis may reveal **cotton wool spots**; a **swollen, pale disc** with **blurred margins**; and a **cherry-red macula**.

Examination of patients presenting later with _permanent visual loss_ may demonstrate **optic atrophy**; a **flat, pale disc**; and a **Marcus-Gunn pupil** with a **positive swinging flashlight test** consistent with an _afferent pupillary defect_.

Patient suspected of having temporal arteritis should receive **high-dose corticosteroid therapy _immediately_,** treatment **should NOT be delayed** to obtain or confirm the biopsy results. **Patients with visual loss should be admitted and given IV steroids.**

**Low dose aspirin** is used to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss or stroke from vessel occlusion.
