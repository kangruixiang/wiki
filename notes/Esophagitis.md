This patient's heartburn is most likely due to **medication-induced esophagitis (MIE)**. Certain medications, including **doxycycline**, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), potassium chloride, and bisphosphonates (eg, alendronate), can become stuck in the esophagus and cause a localized chemical burn to the esophageal mucosa; due to external esophageal compression by the aorta, the **level of the aortic arch** is the most common site of injury. Doxycycline causes injury by becoming **highly acidic** (pH <3) in the presence of water, whereas other medications can cause injury due to hyperosmolarity (potassium chloride) or disruption of the prostaglandin protective barrier (NSAIDs).

Patients with MIE typically have retrosternal burning **chest pain** that may be accompanied by **odynophagia** leading to dysphagia. A history of ingesting a potentially offending medication with minimal water or at bedtime is usually present. The preferred treatment is **discontinuation of the culprit drug**, which typically results in resolution of symptoms within a week. Upper endoscopy is indicated for patients with severe or persistent symptoms. For patients who need to take a potentially offending medication, ingesting the pill with a full glass of water and remaining in an upright position for at least 30 minutes following ingestion can help reduce the risk of esophagitis.
