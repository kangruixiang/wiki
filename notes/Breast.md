# Breast

<!-- Mammary gland made from -->

Milkline/crest forms during 4th week. Milklines are formed from thickening of epidermis..

## Germ layers

<!-- Germ layers development of mammary gland duct epithelial cells and myoepithelial cells -->

**Epidermis** downgrowth into dermis. Ductal epithelial cells that make milk made from **basalis** layer of epidermis. Myoepithelial cells that contract to secrete milk made from **mesenchymal** (fibroblasts, mesoderm) around ducts..

# Anatomy

<!-- Milk production, storage locations -->

Milk produced in the **alveolus** and stored in the **lactiferous sinus**. Contraction of myoepithelial cells forces milk out of the nipple. There are 9-10 lactiferous ducts per breast..

## Glands of Montgomery

<!-- Glands of Montgomery are, function -->

Sebaceous glands of breasts. No hair follicles. Secretes lipoid substances that keep the breast moist.

## Lymphatics

## Estrogen

<!-- Estrogen stimulates what breast development and when -->

stimulates lactiferous duct growth and breast tissue enlargement at puberty.

## Progesterone

<!-- Progesterone stimulates what breast development -->

stimulates formation of secretory alveoli that produces the milk.

<!-- Where do estrogen/progesterone come from during ovulation and pregnancy? -->

Estrogen and progesterone produced from **follicle, corpus leuteum** during ovulation, and from **syncytiotrophoblast of placenta** during pregnancy..

# Lactogenesis

<!-- Stages of milk production and time -->

Stages of milk production:

- **Lactogenesis**, stage 1, late pregnancy: Alveolar cells differentiated from secretory cells and begin producing **colostrom** (fore milk), clear fluid of high protein/mineral concentration and low fat content
- **Stage 2**, 2-3 days after birth: **Colostrum switches to milk production** (hind milk), higher fat content
- **Galactopoiesis**, 9 days after: Milk production/secretion maintained by supply and demand
- **Involution**, 40 days after: Milk production decrease as supplement added..

## Prolactin

<!-- Prolactin is secreted by what cells of the brain and function -->

Secreted by lactotrophs of the anterior pituitary and stimulates **milk production** as well as the **development of milk-producing breast lobules**.

<!-- Prolactin aka -->

Aka **luteotropin**.

<!-- Prolactin produced by -->

Is a hormone named because of its role in lactation, and it is produced by:

- **Maternal adenohypophysis**
- **Fetal adenohypophysis**
- **Decidual tissue of the uterus**..

<!-- 3 Major actions of prolactin -->

**3 major actions:**

- Proliferation of mammary ducts at puberty and during pregnancy (with help of estrogen and progesterone).
- Milk production and secretion in breast in response to suckling by inducing synthesis of milk components: lactose, casein (the protein of milk), and lipids.
- Negative feedback on the hypothalamus causes ↓ GnRH (LH and FSH decrease) → **inhibits ovulation.** (Lactation amenorrhea).

<!-- Prolactin inhibited by what hormones and when -->

During pregnancy the levels of prolactin, estrogen and progesterone increase. This **increases prolactin secretion** from lactotrophs. However, **estrogen and progesterone also down-regulate prolactin receptors, preventing lactation from occurring** during pregnancy. Also **dopamine**..

<!-- Prolactin and dopamine -->

- Inhibited by **dopamine** via binding to **D2 receptors**
- Destruction of hypothalamus leads to high prolactin
- Prolactin feedback on hypothalamus: increases dopamine release..

<!-- When does prolactin production increase -->

At parturition, there is a **precipitous drop in estrogen and progesterone**, and at that point prolactin receptors are no longer down-regulated, allowing the high levels of prolactin seen during pregnancy to take action, thereby triggering lactation to occur..

<!-- What antibody is in milk? Function? -->

Secretory IgA antibody helps to reduce neonatal gut infections since neonates have underdeveloped gut immune system..

<!-- What is requiresd to maintain milk production -->

**Suckling** is required to maintain milk production, because the **increased nerve stimulation** increases oxytocin and prolactin levels..

<!-- What is letdown reflex? -->

The suckling infant stimulates hypothalamus to produce oxytocin that increases milk secretion. This is called **letdown reflex**..

<!-- Pathways that happen as result of letdown reflex -->

Reflex arc activates 3 areas:

- inhibit dopamine (prolactin increase)
- increase oxytocin secretion (contraction of breast myoepithelial cells)
- uterine contraction (pain)..

<!-- Prolactin and TRH -->

Prolactin is increased by TRH:..

## Oxytocin

<!-- Oxytocin secreted by -->

A nonapeptide that is primarily produced by the **paraventricular nuclei** within the **hypothalamus**, and secreted from the posterior pituitary. Like ADH, oxytocin travels to the posterior pituitary via carrier proteins called neurophysins. 

<!-- ADH and oxytocin differ by -->

**Antidiuretic hormone** is homologous to oxytocin.  These nonapeptides only differ in structure by two amino acids..

<!-- Oxytocin stimulas -->

The major stimulus for secretion is **suckling**.  Other positive stimuli include **dilation of the cervix** and **orgasm**.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/AttlsxC.jpg)

<!-- Oxytocin effect -->

The primary effects are **milk ejection** and **uterine contraction.** Causes milk ejection by inducing **contraction of myoepithelial cells in the breast**.

<!-- Oxytocin and bleeding -->

Clinical correlation:  Oxytocin (Pitocin) can be given to **reduce postpartum bleeding** because it causes uterine contraction..

<!-- Oxytocin SE -->

Can have several adverse effects.  These include:

- **Hyponatremia and seizures** (due to anti-diuretic properties similar to antidiuretic hormone)
- **Subarachnoid hemorrhage**
- **Uterine rupture** in pregnant patients.
