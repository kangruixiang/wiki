# heparin induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis

- related: [[Hemeonc]]

## type 1 HITT

- within 2 days of initiating heparin
- transient, non pathologic
- Plt > 100k
- Do not stop heparin, plt will return to normal

## type 2 HITT

- antibody against PF4 => activates Plt => plt cascades => thrombosis and thrombocytopenia
- risks
	- women
	- most often unfractionated heparin
	- CV surgery, ortho surgery, increased trauma severity
	- more or longer heparin => more likely to get HITT
- patients with endothelial damage
- clotting is worse than bleeding
- arterial and venous clot
	- Thrombocytopenia - platelets typically **decline >30%-50%**
	- Timing - onset **5-10 days after heparin** initiation or <1 day with prior, recent heparin exposure
	- Thrombosis - new thrombosis, progressive thrombosis, or skin necrosis
	- Alternative causes - no other sources for thrombocytopenia are present or likely
- interpret based on 4T score
	- e.g. low 4T with positive test: 1% chance positive HITT
- Diagnosis is confirmed with **serotonin release assays** (preferred), heparin-induced platelet aggregation assays, or solid-phase immunoassays with ELISA for heparin-PF4 complexes.
- Stop argatroban: when Plt > 150k, then switch to DOAC or warfarin for minimum of 6 months. ==Initial treatment with warfarin is contraindicated== as rapidly dropping protein C levels cause a prothrombotic state.  Warfarin is usually started after the patient is treated with a non-heparin anticoagulant and recovers a platelet count to **> 150,000/µL**.
