## Passive Vaccine

Includes:

- maternal to fetus

# Vaccine Reactions

## Allergies

<!-- vaccine allergies include which vaccines. Allergic component.. -->

Egg Allergies

- Do not give Yellow fever vaccine

<!-- live attenuated vaccines include, do not give in what population.. -->

- Immunocompromised: AIDS, transplants, biologics drugs (Etanercept), pregnant women
- MMRV
- Flu, intranasal

## Normal Reaction

<!-- normal vs abnormal vaccine reactions.. -->

- If temp < 104
- Erythema
- Consolable

## Abnormal Reaction

- temp > or = 104
- Inconsolable
- frank anaphylaxis

## Scenarios

<!-- vaccine to sick patients or family history of reaction?.. -->

- Sick: give vaccine
- family history: give vaccine
- autism: give vaccine

# Individual Vaccines

- prevent vertical transmission via IVIG and hep B vaccine immediately (**both within 12 hours**)
- mom -: start Hep B series
- mom unknown: give hep B **within 12 hours**, test mom, if positive, give HBIG **within 7 days**

## DTaP

<!-- Dtap vs Tdap doses and when.. -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/rcWx69r.png)

- DTaP: 5 doses. Big D = bigger dose
- TdaP: 1 dose after 11, every 10 years
- Td: booster, can be given instead of TdaP

## HiB

<!-- HiB vaccine given why.. -->
