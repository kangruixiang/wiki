The coagulation studies reveal a normal PT and a prolonged **aPTT**, which  is indicative of an **intrinsic pathway disorder** and is the typical  pattern seen in patients with hemophilia A and B, von Willebrand  disease, and certain acquired disorders. Because the X-linked recessive hemophilias are rare in female patients and this woman has no prior  history of bleeding suggestive of von Willebrand disease, her bleeding  disorder is most likely the result of an acquired coagulation factor  inhibitor. Examples of coagulation factor inhibitors include  antiphospholipid antibodies (which cause thrombosis) and inhibitors of  factors VIII, IX, and XI. Antibodies to factor VIII (''acquired  hemophilia'') can result in potentially severe bleeding, and can occur  independently or be associated with malignancy, pregnancy, lymphoproliferative disorders, or rheumatic disease.
