# AKI note 2 24

- related: [[Nephrology]]

## Definition

- KDIGO criteria
- ![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/20210224133922.png)
- ![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/20210224134136.png)
- creatinine can be affected by medication, secretion, muscle mass
- generation of creatinine lower in septic states
- volume resuscitation can dull change in GFR

## Causes

- Sepsis: most common cause in ICU
- cardiac surgery: 2nd most common cause
- acute liver failure, acetaminophen toxicity
- intra-abdominal HTN: decreased perfusion
- hepatorenal syndrome
- malignancy
- cardiorenal syndrome

## Indications for dialysis

- urea > 150
  ![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/20210224135029.png)
- iHD: mostly does not require heparin during iHD inpatient unless at risk of clotting
	- outpatient: IV heparin during dialysis due to micro clots
- dialysis disequilibrium syndrome: urea removal too quickly
- CRRT: not good for ingestions because slower
- hybrid treatment
	- SLED: intermittent HD 6 hour treatment. Slower iHD
	- prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy: a longer dialysis 8-12 hours treatment
- PD can be acute by surgically place PD catheter

## Hyponatremia

1. is it dangerous: give 3% Na
2. know if it's true hyponatremia (serum osm)
   - hypo-osmolar: true
   - isoosmolar: interfering substance such as TG, IVIG, protein. Check whole blood Na
   - hyper-osmolar (osm > 310): mannitol, hyperglycemia
3. decide volume status

## SIADH

- rule out hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency
- causes:
	- uncontrolled pain, nausea
	- SSRI, AED's, anti neoplastics
	- ecstasy: increase ADH secretion
	- SCC
	- COPD
	- diuretics (thiazides)
- diagnosis: low serum Na, high urine Na, high urine osm
- treatment: fluid restriction
	- 1L very little fluid
	- ![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/20210224161929.png)
	- how much urine is water vs electrolytes
	- 3% if severe or pt NPO
	- salt tabs
	- Ure-Na, palatable urea: makes BUN go up and kidney have osmotic diuresis

## Osmotic demylelination syndrome

- over correct Na
- quadriplegia, mentation changes, dysphagia/dysarthria
- diagnose with MRI
- correction: 6-10 mEq/day is ok, more 6
- potassium repletion contributes to increase in Na
- pt very dehydrated will have high ADH and will self correct when ADH stimulus shut off, easy to over correct (when urine output starts to go up)
- If over correction: re under correct
	- DDAVP (1-2 mcg subq/IV q8h)
	- D5
	- vaptans
	- sometimes give DDAVP/3% together

## Hypernatremia

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/20210224163712.png)

- most common cause is pt not able to communicate free water loss
- vent/trach: high insensible loss
- hyperglycemia: (glucose - 100) x 1.6 + measured Na
- correction: replace free water + urinary loss + insensible loss

## DI

- central, nephrogenic
- drug induced (lithium)
- gestational (degrade vasopressin by vasopressinase by placenta)
- diagnosis
	- > 4L output per day
	- low urine osm, Â± hypernatremia
	- water deprivation test
		- complete: doesn't change urine osm
		- partial: changes some
	- trial of DDAVP
