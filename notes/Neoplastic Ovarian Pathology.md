# Neoplastic Ovarian Pathology

<!-- Ovarian tumor types -->

Ovary is composed of surface epithelium, germ cells (egg), sex cord stroma (theca and granulosa)..

<!-- Ovarian tumors age -->

- 15-30: Germ cell tumors
- 35-40 benign surface
- 60-70 malignant..

# Surface Epithelial Tumors

<!-- Surface Epithelial Tumors epidemiology -->

Most common type of ovarian tumor. They comprise approximately 70% of all ovarian neoplasms, and 80-90% of all malignant ovarian neoplasms.

<!-- Surface epithelium tumor symptoms, prognosis, and spread -->

In general, they carry a poor prognosis.The malignant types of surface epithelial tumors have a tendency to seed the peritoneal cavity. (Spread locally).

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/Wx0SMZ9.jpg)

<!-- Surface epithelial tumors derived from and makes what types of cells -->

Derived from coelomic epithelium (aka surface epithelium) that lines the ovary; coelomic epithelium embryologically **produces the epithelium lining of the fallopian tube (serous cells), endometrium, and endocervix (mucinous cells)**. 

<!-- Surface epithelial tumor subtypes -->

The two most common subtypes of surface epithelial tumors are **serous** (full of watery fluid) and \*\*mucinous \*\*(full of mucus-like fluid); both are usually cystic. 

Less common subtypes of surface epithelial tumors include **endometrioid and Brenner tumor**..

<!-- Surface epithelial tumor classification -->

Mucinous and serous tumors can be classified into one of the following three types:

- **Benign (cystadenomas)**: composed of a single cyst with a simple, flat lining; most commonly arise in premenopausal women (30-40 years old). Cyst: cystic. Adeno: glandular. Oma: benign
  ![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/dt40HVX.jpg)
- **Malignant (cystadenocarcinomas)**: composed of complex cysts with a thick, shaggy lining; most commonly arise in postmenopausal women (60-70 years old)(invade)
- **Borderline**: contain features in between benign and malignant tumors; carry a better prognosis than clearly malignant tumors, but still carry metastatic potential.. 

<!-- Surface epithelial tumor risks, genetic and acquired -->

Major risk factors: 

- Genetic: **BRCA1 mutation, Lynch syndrome (HNPCC)** (BRCA increases fallopian tube and ovary serous carcinoma. Carriers often elect to have prophylactic salpingo oophorectomy and mastectomy)
- The risk is decreased with a history of breastfeeding, OCPs, and pregnancy. 

<!-- Surface epithelial treatment response and screen marker -->

Clinically, the tumor marker that can be used to monitor is **serum CA-125**.

## Serous tumor

<!-- Serous tumor is, resembles -->

**Serous Tumors** of the ovary are derived from coelomic epithelium, and in the case of the serous tumors, they differentiate into tubal epithelium. Approximately 60% are benign, and roughly 15% are considered borderline malignancy. These occur most commonly in women of reproductive age. The malignant tumors comprise 25% of cases and tend to occur in older patients.. 

<!-- Serous tumors epidemiology -->

The most common benign and malignant types of ovarian tumors _overall_.

<!-- Serous tumors of the ovary location -->

Are often **bilateral**, and this is particularly true for the malignant subtypes..

<!-- Serous cystadenoma histology -->

Histology will appear as **lined ciliated cells with fallopian tube-like epithelium.**

Malignant type will reveal **psammoma bodies**(dystrophic calcification), and demonstrate invasive papillary histology.

## Mucinous Tumors

<!-- Mucinous Tumors, resembles -->

 Are derived from coelomic epithelium, they differentiate into mucus-secreting epithelium that **resembles the endocervix**. They represent approximately 20% of all ovarian tumors, and 10% of all malignant ovarian tumors..

<!-- Mucinous tumors of the ovary location, histology -->

Most commonly **unilateral** (whereas serous tumors are commonly bilateral), solid, rarely calcify to form psammoma bodies, and are often large (>10 cm) cystic tumors..

<!-- Mucinous cystadenoma of the ovary histology -->

Mucinous cystadenoma histology will reveal multilocular cysts **lined by endocervical-like mucus-secreting epithelial cells**..

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/WImoNXB.jpg)

<!-- What is pseudomyxoma peritonei. What is it most often caused by -->

Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary commonly rupture to produce **pseudomyxoma peritonei**, which is an intraperitoneal accumulation of mucinous material from ovarian or appendiceal tumor (mucinous ascites). However, pseudomyxoma peritonei is most often caused by a tumor of the appendix, not the ovaries..

## Endometrioid Tumor

<!-- Endometrioid Tumor of the ovary is -->

A less common subtype of surface epithelial tumor; composed of endometrial-like glands and are **usually malignant**..

<!-- Endometrioid tumors of ovary cause -->

 **commonly occur in setting of endometriosis** (ectopic endometrial tissue) within the ovary with cyst formation. Approximately 15% of endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary are associated with an independent endometrial carcinoma (endometrioid type, urothelium). When endometriosis occurs within the ovary it commonly results in the formation of a "**Chocolate Cyst,**" which is an endometrioma filled with dark, reddish-brown blood..

<!-- Endometrioid tumors of the ovary symptoms -->

Clinically present with **pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia**; symptoms commonly vary with the menstrual cycle. A complex mass will often be observed on ultrasound. Possess histopathological features similar to endometrial cancer of the uterus..

## Brenner Tumor

<!-- Brenner Tumor of the ovary is -->

A less common subtype of surface epithelial ovarian tumors. The majority are **benign**, but some can be malignant..

<!-- Brenner tumors of the ovary gross and histology -->

Appear as a solid tumor that is pale yellow-tan and appears encapsulated

Histology will often reveal **"Coffee bean" nuclei** with H\&E staining. They are also characterized by Walthard’s rests, which are islands of **bladder-like transitional epithelium** within a fibrous stroma.

# Germ Cell Tumors

<!-- Germ Cell Tumors demographics and epidemiology -->

Second most common type of ovarian tumor (approximately 15% of cases), and they usually only occur in women of **reproductive age.**(15-30).

<!-- Germ cell tumor subtypes -->

Can mimic tissues that are normally produced by germ cells, and we can use microscopy to make a diagnosis based on the tissue produced:

- Fetal Tissue: cystic teratoma (tumor with different embryo layers), embryonal carcinoma (primitive cells)
- Oocytes: dysgerminoma 
- Yolk Sac: endodermal sinus tumor
- Placental Tissue: choriocarcinoma.

## Dysgerminoma

<!-- Dysgerminoma histology -->

 Tumor composed of large cells with clear cytoplasm and central nuclei (resemble oocytes). Dys: bad. Germ: germ cell.

## Seminoma

<!-- seminoma is -->

Testicular counterpart to the dysgerminoma, which is a relatively common germ cell tumor in males.

<!--  Dysgerminomas diagnosis and tumor markers -->

Diagnosed by histology, and the measurement of the following tumor markers can also be used to confirm the diagnosis:

- **Increased levels of hCG**
- **Increased levels of LDH**.

<!-- Dysgerminoma. Who has increased risks -->

Patients with streak gonads, such as those seen in Turner Syndrome, have an increased risk.. As a result, patients with Turner Syndrome often have their ovaries prophylactically removed.

<!-- Dysgerminomas prognosis and treatment -->

carry a **good prognosis**, and they respond very well to **radiation**.. 

## Teratomas

<!-- Teratomas are made of -->

Tumors that are comprised of tissue elements derived from **two or three embryonic layers**:

- Endoderm (e.g. bronchial, thyroid tissue)

- Mesoderm (e.g. cartilage, bone)

- Ectoderm (e.g. hair, skin, neural tissue).

<!-- teratoma symptoms -->

Commonly presents with pain that is secondary to ovarian enlargement or torsion.

<!-- Teratoma prognosis -->

Benign, but presence of immature tissue (usually neural) or somatic malignancy (usually squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) indicates malignant potential.. 

## Struma ovarii

<!-- Struma ovarii is, symptoms -->

aka monodermal teratoma, is a rare form of monodermal teratoma that is mostly comprised of thyroid tissue, and often leads to symptoms of _hyperthyroidism_. They are usually unilateral, and **most commonly seen in mature teratomas**.

<!-- Fibromas association and symptoms -->

Are classically associated with **Meigs syndrome**. which consists of the following triad of findings: 

- **Ovarian fibroma**
- **Ascites**
- \*\*Pleural effusion \*\*(commonly on the right side)

A common symptom in patients with Meigs syndrome is the complaint of a **pulling sensation in the groin**. The syndrome will resolve with removal of the tumor.

## Granulose-Cell Tumor

<!-- Granulosa- Cell Tumor demographics -->

A **neoplastic proliferation of granulosa cells**, and it is the most common malignant stromal tumor (commonly seen in women in their 50s).. 

<!-- Granulosa cell tumors pre and post menoposal symptoms association -->

are **estrogen-secreting tumors**, and patients will present with signs of estrogen excess. The clinical presentation of hyperestrinism varies by the age of the patient:

- **Prior to puberty**: precocious (early) puberty
- **Reproductive age**: menorrhagia or metrorrhagia 
- \*\*Postmenopause \*\*(most common): endometrial hyperplasia with vaginal/uterine bleeding.

In postmenopausal women granulosa cell tumors are highly associated with **endometrial hyperplasia and the development of endometrial carcinoma.** Although these are malignant tumors, they often carry a minimal risk for metastasis. 

<!-- Granulose Cell tumor histology -->

Histology reveal cells with scanty cytoplasm and angulated, coffee-bean, grooved nuclei. **The classic features are Call-Exner bodies**. which are granulosa cells arranged in small follicles filled with eosinophilic secretions in the center.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/vIabMO4.jpg)

Note: although these tumors most commonly occur in males, they can also develop in females because they are derived from sex-cord stromal tissue. 

# Metastasis

<!-- Ovarian tumors metastasize from -->

Metastasis to the ovary comprise roughly 5% of all cases of ovarian tumors, and they will most frequently originate from primaries found in the:

- **Gastrointestinal tract** (i.e. Gastric Carcinoma - Diffuse type)
- **Breast**
- **Uterus**
- **Appendix** (pseudomyxoma peritonei)..

## Krukenberg Tumor

<!-- Krukenberg tumor is, unilateral or bilateral, and cause -->

Metastatic mucinous tumor that involves _both_ ovaries, and is most commonly due to a metastatic gastric carcinoma (diffuse type)..

<!-- Krukenberg tumor differentiate from primary tumor -->

_Bilaterality_ helps distinguish a metastasis from a primary mucinous carcinoma of the ovary, which is usually _unilateral_..

<!-- Krukenberg tumor spread -->

The most common route of metastasis is hematogenous..

<!-- Krukenberg tumor histology -->

Histology of the tumors will reveal **signet ring cells** and mucin-secreting cells.

## Pseudomyxoma peritonei

<!-- Pseudomyxoma peritonei is, cause -->

Condition that is characterized by massive amounts of mucus in the peritoneum (jelly belly). It is most commonly caused by a **mucinous tumor of the appendix**, usually with metastasis to the ovary. (primary tumor in appendix, mucous in peritoneum, mets to ovary).
