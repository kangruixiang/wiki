Screening for anemia is routine at the first prenatal visit. Patients with thalassemia minor (ie, thalassemia trait) have mild **microcytic, hypochromic anemia**, as indicated by a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin, respectively. They also have **mildly elevated ferritin** due to **increased red blood cell (RBC) turnover**. The RBC count may be normal or increased, but the **red cell distribution width (RDW) is normal** as almost all RBCs are uniformly small. In addition, the anemia is relatively mild in comparison with the decrease in MCV.

This patient's results are consistent with thalassemia minor, which is  common in those of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian,  African, and Indian descent. A maternal **hemoglobin electrophoresis** should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and distinguish α- from  β-thalassemia minor. Electrophoresis is normal in patients with  α-thalassemia; β-thalassemia causes abnormally elevated hemoglobin A2  levels.

After confirmation of maternal  thalassemia, a paternal hemoglobin electrophoresis is indicated to  determine the fetal risk of thalassemia major. Maternal conditions  requiring partner testing include clinically significant maternal  hemoglobinopathies (eg, SS, SC, hemoglobin S/β-thalassemia) as well as  carrier states (α- and β-thalassemia minor).
