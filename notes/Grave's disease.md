The majority of patients receiving **radioactive iodine therapy** show improvement in 4-8 weeks, and up to 80% of patients develop hypothyroidism between 2-6 months following treatment.  However, post-treatment hypothyroidism can sometimes be transient and self-limited.

**TSH** may **remain suppressed for months** after the resolution of hyperthyroidism and does not always indicate ongoing hyperthyroidism.  The most appropriate next steps are to **obtain T3 and T4 levels**, evaluate patient symptoms, and monitor the patient with occasional clinical examinations.  This patient has symptoms of hypothyroidism with a suppressed TSH level.  If the T3 and T4 levels indicate chemical hypothyroidism, she should be started on levothyroxine **(Choice C)**.  If the levels are normal, she should be reassessed again in 4-8 weeks **(Choice B)**.
