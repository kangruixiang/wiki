# gout

- related: [[Rheumatology]]
---

- risks: obesity, alcohol, DM, men, aging
- premenopausal women don't have gout
- not every one with increased uric acid has gout
- hyperuricemia >7 for male, >6 for female
	- if > 10, risk increases to 30-50%
	- goal < 6 if diagnosed with gout

## Pathogenesis

- pathogenesis: over producer or under excretor
	- can do 24 hour collection. > 800mg in urine = overproducer. <800 = underexcretor (90% of problem)

- stages:
	- asymptomatic hyperuricemia: decades
	- acute intermittent gout: 8-15 years
	- tophus: chronic
	- nephrolithiasis
	- time shortened or renal transplant pts on immunosuppresants

- triggers:
	- alcohol
	- hemorrhage
	- dietary excess of purines
	- stress: infections/trauma/surgery/exercise
	- drugs: CANT LEAP, levodopa, theophylline, starting allopurinol
		- cyclosporine
		- alcohol
		- nicotinic acid
		- thiazides
		- lasix
		- ethambutol
		- aspirin
		- pyrazinamide
		- can help: losartan, amlodipine, fenofibrate
	- radiation
	- fructose drink ingestion

- suggested diet:
	- moderate calorie restriction
	- increase in proportional protein intake
	- increase low fat dairy products
	- limit high fructose
	- limit organ meats, seafoods

## Diagnosis

- clinical findings: suspected vs probable
- imaging confirmation
- MSU crystals, negative birefringent, yellow when parallel
- inflammatory synovial fluid, neutrophil predominant
- septic synovial fluid may contain urate crystals
- intracellular crystals more confident to be gout than extracellular (phagocytosed). If only extracellular, think about infections
- during acute attack, serum uric acid level can be low or high

## Treatment

Colchicine is effective for acute gouty arthritis, but is limited by frequent gastrointestinal side effects and is a second-line agent.  Colchicine is less effective than corticosteroids.  Chronic administration in CKD patients can lead to colchicine accumulation in the blood and cause significant neuromyopathy.

## Prevention

### Allopurinol

- starting dose: no greater than 100mg/day

- CKD4 or worse: start at 50mg/day

- max dose: 800mg

- titrate 2-5 weeks to max dose. Can increase above 300mg daily, even with renal impairment

- toxicity: hypersensitivity reaction, elevated hepatic enzymes

- don't use with azathioprine/mercaptopurine = pancytopenia

- may potentiate warfarin

- gout with tophi: even with goal uric acid, likelihood of gout flare up is higher than normal, 6 months colchicine with allopurinol

### Urloric

- feboxostat Urloric
	- dose once a day, can increase to 80mg
	- advantage: can be used in Cr < 30, if allergic to allopurinol
	- if gout flare occurs, does not need to be discontinued
	- really used when CI to allopurinol

- colchicine: 6 months therapy when starting chronic ppx. 0.6mg BID

- Can also use NSAID or prednisone < 10mg

- don't use colchicine with clarithromycin/CYP

- probenecid: excretes uric acid, CI in CKD pts or kidney stones

- start treating tout:
	- tophus
	- frequent attacks, 2 or more a year
	- CKD 2 or worse: 1 gout attack
	- hx of urolithiasis
