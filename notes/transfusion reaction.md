Leukoreduction involves reducing the number of transfused leukocytes  through filtering or other methods such as saline washing, freezing and  deglycerolizing, or buffy coat removal. It also reduces the risk of _human leukocyte antigen_ alloimmunization and transmission of cytomegalovirus (which typically  resides in leukocytes). Premedication with antipyretics and  antihistamines has not been shown to significantly reduce transfusion  reactions.

Residual plasma in red cell concentrates contains proteins, including  immunoglobulin A (IgA). IgA-deficient patients develop antibodies  against IgA. These antibodies can react with IgA-containing donor  products and induce an anaphylactic reaction (angioedema, hypotension,  and respiratory distress) that can progress rapidly to loss of  consciousness, shock, and respiratory failure. To reduce this risk, red cells should be washed to remove as much of the plasma as possible for  patients with IgA deficiency or prior allergic transfusion reaction.

## Transfusion reaction

This patient is likely having an acute hemolytic  transfusion reaction (AHTR), which typically develops within an hour  after the transfusion is started. AHTR is a medical emergency usually  caused by ABO incompatibility (possibly due to clerical error) or  presence of other antibodies.  Patients who require chronic red cell  transfusions (eg, African American patients with sickle cell anemia) may form multiple antibodies to common Rh, Kell, or other blood group  antigens.

Patients typically present with fever,  chills, hemoglobinuria, flank pain, and discomfort at the infusion  site. This may advance to renal failure (due to immune complex  deposition) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Diagnosis is made by a positive direct Coombs test, pink plasma (plasma free  hemoglobin >25 mg/dL), hemoglobinuria, and repeat type and cross-match showing a mismatch.

AHTR should be managed by immediately stopping the transfusion and  aggressively hydrating the patient with normal saline (not Ringer's or  dextrose) to treat the hypotension and prevent renal failure.
