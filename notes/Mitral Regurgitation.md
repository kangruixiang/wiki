## Mitral Regurgitation

### Pathogenesis

Mitral regurgitation, also known as mitral insufficiency, refers to the **retrograde flow of blood through the mitral valve** from the left ventricle to the left atrium **during systole** due to anomalies of the mitral valve or the papillary muscles.

Myocardial infarction involving **supply to the papillary muscles** can cause them not to function properly, leading to mitral insufficiency.

[[mitral valve prolapse]] is the most common cause of mitral regurgitation as the prolapsed and “floppy” valve is unable to hold against the pressure differences experienced during ventricular systole.

Intrinsic valvular damage can be caused by **infective endocarditis** and **rheumatic fever**.

Diseases that cause dilation of the left ventricle (e.g. aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation) can lead to mitral regurgitation by **stretching the mitral valve annulus**.

Rarely, **ergotamine**, **pergolide**, and **cabergoline** can cause mitral regurgitation. Note that this is _far less common_ than other etiologies, and should only be considered as a possibility after having ruled out others definitively--_even if a patient is taking one of these drugs!_

### Symptoms

[[Acute mitral regurgitation can cause acute heart failure]]

Acute mitral regurgitation presents with **jugular venous distention and sudden onset of congestive heart failure**, while chronic disease presents with an **apical thrill without signs of congestive heart failure**.

Acute mitral regurgitation presents with the **rapid onset of severe congestive heart failure** with a **low cardiac output**, and is commonly due to rupture of a recently infarcted papillary muscle (i.e. a patient who has suffered a myocardial infarction within the past couple of days).

In acute onset mitral regurgitation, the left atrium is unable to remodel rapidly enough to accommodate the increased volume. This leads to a **rapid increase in left atrial filling pressure**, resulting in **increased pulmonary capillary pressure** and pulmonary edema.

Patients with chronic mitral regurgitation may be asymptomatic with normal exercise tolerance; however, they are often sensitive to shifts in volume status and may be at risk for development of **acute volume overload** (flash pulmonary edema) and **right-sided heart failure**.

Mitral regurgitation causes a **high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the axilla**. _Remember that mitral regurgitation often occurs in patients with mitral valve prolapse, so the murmur of mitral regurgitation may co-occur with a mid-systolic click._

### Diagnosis

Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings in chronic disease may include **notched P waves** referred to as **P mitrale**, which may also be observed in the setting of mitral stenosis and other left atrial overload states. Over time, mitral regurgitation may lead to **atrial fibrillation**.

Dilation of the left atrium in chronic mitral regurgitation leads to an **enlarged cardiac silhouette** on chest X-ray.

The diagnostic modality of choice is **echocardiography with color Doppler**, which demonstrates **regurgitant flow**.

Mitral regurgitation may cause a **widely split S2** as the regurgitant flow leads to earlier emptying of the left ventricle, allowing the aortic valve to close much earlier than the pulmonic valve.

Mitral regurgitation can be associated with an **S3** heart sound.

### Treatment

Medical management is indicated in symptomatic patients with the goal of reducing afterload and thus regurgitant flow. Agents used include:

- **Diuretics**
- **Nitrates** (also reduce preload)
- **ACE inhibitors** or **ARBs**
- **Beta blockers**

**Open mitral valve replacement** is curative, and is indicated in the setting of very severe, symptomatic disease. Synthetic valves require ongoing anticoagulation and biosynthetic valves have a limited lifespan, making valve repair the treatment of choice in patients with a valve intact enough to withstand the procedure.
