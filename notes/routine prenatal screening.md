At **24-28 weeks gestation**, all pregnant women should undergo screening for anemia with a hemoglobin/hematocrit or a **complete blood count** (which can be compared to results from the initial prenatal visit).  **Physiologic anemia** occurs in most pregnancies secondary to an expanding plasma volume that is disproportionate to the increase in red blood cell mass.  Iron requirements increase in pregnancy; treatment of physiologic anemia is with iron supplementation.

**Gestational diabetes mellitus** screening is also performed at 24-28 weeks due to the rise in human placental lactogen, a hormone secreted by the placenta that increases fetal glucose supply by inducing maternal insulin resistance.  Women with a positive 50-g 1-hour glucose challenge test undergo a subsequent confirmatory 100-g 3-hour glucose tolerance test prior to the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus.

In addition, Rh(D)-negative women should undergo **antibody screening** and receive an anti-D immune globulin injection.
