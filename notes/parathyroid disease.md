<!-- tertiary hyperparathyroidism parathyroidectomy indication -->

Indications for **parathyroidectomy** in tertiary hyperparathyroidism include:

- Persistently elevated calcium (eg, >10.5 mg/dL), phosphorus, or PTH (eg, >800 pg/mL) levels
- Soft tissue calcification or calciphylaxis (vascular calcification with skin necrosis)
- Intractable bone pain or pruritus

Bisphosphonates are generally not recommended in end-stage renal disease as they reduce bone turnover, leading to osteomalacia, mixed uremic  osteodystrophy, and adynamic bone disease. They can also cause a  worsening of hyperparathyroidism.
