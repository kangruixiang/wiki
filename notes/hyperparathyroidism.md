- primary hyperparathyroidism: inappropriate high PTH
	- high PTH, high Ca
- secondary: chronically low Ca in renal failure
	- high PTH, low Ca
- tertiary: renal failure, unresponsive.
	- high PTH, high Ca
- familial hypocalciuria hypercalcemia: abnormal Ca sensor, higher setpoint
	- can look like primary
	- nl PTH, high Ca, **low urinary Ca**

## Primary hyperparathyroidism management

<!-- Primary hyperparathyroidism management -->

- regular follow up with serum Ca, creatinine, DXA scanning
	- Asymptomatic and age >50
- Surgery:
	- Symptomatic, established complications, or age <50
	- Elevated Ca >1 above normal or urinary Ca > 400

Patients with PHPT are often erroneously advised to  restrict calcium and vitamin D, leading to an increased risk for  osteoporosis. However, careful supplementation with periodic monitoring is appropriate.

Nuclear scintigraphy is used to identify the location of a parathyroid  adenoma or hyperplasia prior to surgery. However, for patients in whom  surgery is not indicated, scintigraphy would not change management and  is unnecessary.

Although hyperparathyroidism is a component of certain multiple  endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes, these conditions are rare and  screening is not indicated in the absence of additional symptoms or a  family history of MEN.
