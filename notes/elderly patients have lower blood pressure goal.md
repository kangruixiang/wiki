# elderly patients have lower blood pressure goal

- related: [[Hypertension]]

Many experts advise a blood pressure goal of <150/90 mm Hg for patients age >80.  Patients with established cardiovascular disease or heart failure may benefit from more aggressive control, however elderly patients with low baseline diastolic pressure, such as this patient, may not tolerate more aggressive control of systolic blood pressure.  This patient's blood pressure should be followed closely, and his medication regimen should be individualized based on the course over time.
