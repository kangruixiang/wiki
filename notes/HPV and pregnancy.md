# HPV and pregnancy

<!-- HPV and pregnancy risk, sx, management -->

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually  transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer. In immunocompetent  women, HPV usually causes a transient infection. Immunosuppressed  patients (eg, HIV infection) are unable to clear HPV and are at  increased risk for **persistent HPV** infection that can  progress to cervical dysplasia and cancer. Therefore, patients newly  diagnosed with HIV are recommended to have a Pap test immediately after  diagnosis followed by close interval screening. In patients with HIV,  invasive cervical cancer is an **AIDS-defining illness**.

Most patients diagnosed with cervical dysplasia are asymptomatic. **Invasive cervical cancer** typically presents in patients who have not had routine Pap test  screening and can be asymptomatic. However, the most common presenting  features of invasive cervical cancer are **irregular vaginal bleeding** and a **friable, exophytic cervical mass**. Other features of cervical cancer include postcoital bleeding; watery, mucoid vaginal discharge; and  ulcerative cervical lesions. Suspicious cervical lesions require a **cervical biopsy** to evaluate for cancer. Additional risk factors for cervical cancer  include tobacco use, prior sexually transmitted infection, and multiple  sexual partners.

HPV can be vertically transmitted.  Children with vertically transmitted HPV typically present with lesions in the oropharynx, larynx, or trachea at age 2-5; the most severe manifestation is juvenile-onset respiratory papillomatosis (JRP).  There is an association between JRP, childhood HPV disease, and maternal HPV disease.  However, cesarean delivery does not prevent vertical transmission or decrease the risk for JRP or childhood HPV disease.  Therefore, expectant management for vaginal delivery is the best management for this patient.

A 39-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 2, at 7 weeks gestation comes to the emergency department for vaginal bleeding that began 3 hours ago and has soaked through a pad. Since her arrival, the bleeding has  subsided. She reports no abdominal pain or cramping. Her first  prenatal visit is in 1 week. The patient has a history of HIV, contracted 3 years ago through unprotected sexual intercourse, but she has declined treatment as she  has fel"healthy." She has no previous surgeries. The patient's 2  prior pregnancies ended in uncomplicated term vaginal deliveries; the last delivery was 4 years ago. Her last Pap test, 4 years ago, was normal. She has smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day for 13 years but does not drink alcohol or use  illicit drugs. Blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg and pulse is 82/min. BMI is 24 kg/m2. Abdominal examination shows no tenderness or masses. The external genitalia have no lesions. Speculum examination reveals minimal bright red blood in the vaginal vault. The cervix is closed and there is a 3-cm, firm, white, irregular mass on the anterior cervix that bleeds when touched with a cotton applicator. Laboratory results are as follows:
