During the second and third trimesters, the placenta secretes increasing amounts of hormones (eg, human placental lactogen) that induce maternal insulin resistance.  This insulin resistance ensures that there is a sufficient supply of glucose for fetal development.  However, patients with inadequate pancreatic function are at risk for developing **gestational diabetes mellitus** (GDM).  GDM is associated with obstetric (eg, preeclampsia) and neonatal (eg, hypoglycemia, polycythemia) complications.  Patients with risk factors for undiagnosed pregestational type 2 DM (eg, obesity, prior macrosomic infant) are screened as early as the initial prenatal visit.  Patients without risk factors are screened for GDM at 24-28 weeks gestation.

Hemoglobin A1c levels are lower in pregnant women due to physiologic increases in red blood cell mass and cell turnover.  Therefore, a hemoglobin A1c is a less sensitive screening test for DM during pregnancy than a GCT.

A **2-step approach** is involved in screening for GDM.  The first step is a **glucose challenge test** (GCT), a **screening test** that consists of a blood glucose level measured an hour after administration of a 50-g glucose load.  A blood glucose level >140 mg/dL is an indication for the second step, a **3-hour glucose tolerance test** (GTT).  The GTT is a **diagnostic test** that consists of a fasting blood glucose and blood glucose levels measured 1, 2, and 3 hours after a 100-g glucose load.  GDM is diagnosed when >2 of the GTT values are elevated.  This patient has an elevated GCT and requires a 3-hour GTT **(Choice D)**.

**Insulin**, **metformin**, and **glyburide** are all acceptable agents for control of gestational diabetes when **dietary modifications** do not achieve adequate glycemic control.  Although there is some transplacental passage of insulin, it is not teratogenic.  Metformin can cross the placenta, and the transplacental passage of glyburide is not well established; however, both medications appear to be safe in pregnancy.
