**Asplenic patients** are at increased risk of infection from encapsulated organisms such as _Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae_, and _Neisseria meningitidis_.  Overwhelming infection in asplenic patients is rare but rapidly fatal if not recognized and treated aggressively at an early stage.  On presentation, the patient may have mild symptoms and not appear toxic, but the infection can **progress within hours** to fulminant disease with severe shock, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Consequently, any **febrile illness** in an asplenic patient should prompt aggressive **antibiotic therapy**, even if the patient appears relatively stable **(Choices B and C)**.  Acceptable empiric oral regimens include amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, or extended-spectrum fluoroquinolones (eg, levofloxacin).

**(Choices A and D)**  Treatment should continue for at least 72 hours while urgent diagnostic evaluation (eg, blood cultures, radiographs) is performed.  Patients with signs of severe illness should receive empiric broad-spectrum coverage such as combination vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
