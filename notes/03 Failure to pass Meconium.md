# 03 Failure to pass Meconium

<!-- newborn constipation 2 major categories, causes, timeline.. -->

Newborn constipation has to causes:

- Failure to pass meconium: nothing comes out in **first 24 - 48 hrs**
	- Biliary emesis: anything obstructing
	- Imperforate anus
	- Meconium Ileus
	- Hirschsprung: can present in either first 48 hrs or yr 2
- Constipation in general: decrease in frequency, increase in difficulty/hardness in **year 2**
	- voluntary holding
	- medication SE
	- diet
	- anatomy
	- neurologic problems (rare)

# Imperforate anus

<!-- imperforate anus path, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

- Path: part of VACTRL
- symptoms: no hole, maybe stool if fistula present
- diagnosis: xray (cross table)
- treatment
	- Mild: anus where it supposed to be but not connected. Surgery now
	- Severe: anus pouch far from skin. Wait for baby to get bigger with more colon. Colostomy now and fix later
	- Watch out for VACTERL

## VACTERL

<!-- VACTERL management in imperforate anus.. -->

Prepare for intubation vs surgery. See if heart and tracheal look good

- Vertebral: US sacrum
- Anal: X-Ray
- Cardiac: Echocardiogram
- TracheoEsophageal: Catheter with X-ray from nostril to stomach. Coiled up
- Renal: VCUG
- Limb: X ray wrist

## Colostomy

<!-- colostomy is -->

a surgical operation in which a piece of the colon is diverted to an artificial opening in the abdominal wall so as to bypass a damaged part of the colon.,

# Meconium Ileus

<!-- meconium ileus path, demo, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

- path: CF
- Demographics: infant failure to pass meconium with prenal screen positive or no prenatal care
- diagnosis: x-ray show transition point and gas filled plug. **Echogenic bowel on prenatal ultrasound** can be an early hint.
- treatment:
	- water-enema to diagnose and dissolve plug
	- CF: sweet chloride test to confirm, ADEK supplement, pancreatic enzyme, pulmonary toilet to prevent respiratory infections

# Hirschsprung

<!-- hirschprung path, demo, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

- path: failure of migration of Auerbach and Meissner plexus inhibitory neurons that allow relaxation. Fails to innervate distal colon
- demographics:
	- 90%: failure to pass meconium: palpable colon, distended, explosive diarrhea on digital rectal exam
	- 10%: chronic diarrhea with overflow incontinence. Enough good colon push liquid part of stool around obstruction = watery diarrhea
- diagnosis
	- Step 1: xray. Bad colon normal. Good colon dilated
	- 90%: contrast enema to see transition point
	- 10%: anal rectal manometry: increased tone
	- best test: biopsy show no plexus
- treatment: surgical resect bad colon

# Voluntary holding

<!-- voluntary holding path, demo, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

- path: fear of pain, defecation, embarrassment. Water absorbed as stool sits = hard stool = constipation
- demographics: cognitive impaired higher risk
	- begin toilet training and going to school for first time
	- voluntary holding at first turn involuntary
	- overflow incontinence: water
	- encopresis: stooling in bed. Liquidy stool comes out
- diagnosis: clinical. Bowel habits
- treatment
	- bowel regiments. Stool softeners, motility agents, behavior modification
	- disimpaction: under anesthesia unlike adults
