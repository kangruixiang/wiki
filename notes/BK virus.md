<!-- BK virus risks, sx, dx, rx -->

- After renal transplantation, patients are at risk of allograft  dysfunction from a wide variety of mechanisms.
- The biopsy findings here of basophilic intranuclear inclusions are characteristic of BK-virus induced nephropathy.
- The BK virus is a **polyomavirus** that is well-known to cause nephritis in  renal transplant recipients who are immunosuppressed, with a prevalence  of about 5%.
- Urinalysis in patients with BK-nephritis is consistent  with interstitial nephritis, and urine cytology often shows infected  cells with an enlarged nucleus and a single basophilic intranuclear  inclusion. PCR can be used to identify BK viral DNA in the plasma of  patients suspected of having this infection. Diagnosis should be  confirmed with an allograft biopsy.
- Treatment consists of decreasing  the immunosuppression and, in some, antiviral therapy.

A 46-year-old male undergoes a cadaveric kidney transplant for rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. His past medical history is significant for hepatitis C, hypertension, and  type 2 diabetes mellitus. The surgery is uncomplicated, and when he is discharged, his BUN is 12 mg/dL and creatinine is 1.2 mg/dL. His immunosuppression regimen includes cyclosporine, mycophenolate, and  low-dose prednisone. Five weeks after the procedure, he complains of  malaise. His BUN is 28 mg/dL and creatinine is 2.1 mg/dL. A renal allograft biopsy shows evidence of renal tubular damage with **prominent basophilic intranuclear inclusions**. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his decreased renal function?
