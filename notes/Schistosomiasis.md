This young man with ==terminal hematuria== (blood at the end of micturition) has a history of extensive travel to a schistosomiasis-endemic area; his laboratory studies are notable for ==eosinophilia==, hematuria, and leukocyturia without bacteriuria or glomerular casts.  These findings are consistent with _Schistosoma haematobium_ infection.  In contrast to acute schistosomiasis syndrome or Katayama fever (more frequent in travelers with no immunity), **chronic schistosomiasis** most commonly occurs in patients who live in endemic areas or have frequent exposure to contaminated fresh water.  Symptoms depend on the infection site (Table).  **Genitourinary schistosomiasis** (due to _S haematobium_) can present with dysuria, urinary frequency, bladder outlet obstruction, or **terminal hematuria**.

Disease largely occurs due to a granulomatous immune reaction to the deposits of schistosomal eggs in the tissues.  In patients from endemic areas, diagnosis is made by identifying and quantifying eggs in the urine or stool; in travelers, serology is best due to lighter disease burden and higher test sensitivity.  Chronic infection should be treated with praziquantel.
