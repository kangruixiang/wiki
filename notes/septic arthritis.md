## Causes

<!-- septic arthritis spread, risks, organisms, types -->

**Septic arthritis** is an **infection of the synovial joint space**.

Septic arthritis can occur through **hematogenous spread, local extension, or direct inoculation** (trauma).

- **_S. aureus_**: most common, **more than 50% of cases**
	- children > 2
	- invasive procedures
- **Streptococci**
- **S. epidermidis**: foreign bodies, prosthetic joints
- _**N. gonorrhoeae**_: In young, sexually active patients who are otherwise healthy
- _**Salmonella**_: sickle cell disease
- _**P. aeruginosa and GNR**_: in IV drug users and diabetics
- **fungal and candida infections**: immunocompromised patients

## Symptoms

<!-- septic arthritis sx -->

- Acute onset, monoarticular
- Joints affected: knee > hip > wrists > shoulder > ankles
- triad: fever, joint pain, decreased ROM

Physical exam findings in septic arthritis include a **warm, red, and tender joint** with **possible skin lesions over the affected area**.

## Diagnosis

<!-- septic arthritis dx -->

- Serum:
	- WBC count > 10,000
	- ESR > 30
	- CRP > 5
- Joint aspirate:
	- Definitive: positive gm stain or culture
	- Presumptive: **WBC count > 50,000** with purulent fluid
	- also shows a **high neutrophil count and low glucose**.
- Imaging: Ultrasound and MRI can help **confirm joint effusion** in septic arthritis.

## Treatment

<!-- septic arthritis rx -->

- 2 sets of blood cultures to assess origin
- **surgical irrigation and drainage of the affected joint**.
- Empiric abx:
	- GPC: vancomycin
	- GNC: ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolone
	- GNR: 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins: ceftazidime, cefepime, pip-tazo, carbapenem
	- Penicillinase-resistant penicillins: oxacillin, naficillin, cefazolin
	- suspected pseudomonas: IV ceftazidime + IV aminoglycoside
	- N gonorrhea: rocephin and azithromycin or doxy (for chlamydia), surgical drainage usually not necessary
- Tailor abx for 2 weeks
	- concomitant bacteremia: at least IV 4 weeks
	- endocarditis: tailor duration to endocarditis duration

**Monitoring CRP** is the best measure of treatment efficacy in cases of septic arthritis.
