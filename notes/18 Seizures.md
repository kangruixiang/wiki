# 18 Seizures

<!-- seizures path, types.. -->

- Path: synchronous firing of awake brain
- Loc
	- positive: complex
	- negative: simple

|                 | Generalized    | Focal/Partial   |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| LOC - Complex   | Grand mal      | partial complex |
| No LOC - Simple | Pseudo seizure | partial simple  |

- Grandmal: loc, bowel/bladder incontinence, tongue biting, postictal
- partial complex: partial because not entire brain. Complex because loc
- partial simple: someone's hand, arm, brain twitch
- pseudo seizure: faking it
	- kids can have **atonic** seizure: loss of muscle tone but not loc

## Seizure vs. Epilepsy

<!-- ignore.. -->

- Seizure: one time, use VITAMINS formula
- Epilepsy: recurrent, disease

## Diagnosis and treatment

<!-- seizures diagnosis and treatment.. -->

- diagnosis: EEG only when having seizure. Can be provoked with rapid flashing light or sleep deprivation
- treatment: anti epileptic drug. Same in kids and adults
	- levetiracetam most often
	- backup: phenytoin, valproic, lamotrigrine
	- absence: ethusuxomide
	- tic douloureux (trigeminal neuralgia. Seizure of trigeminal nerve): carbamazapine

# Pediatric Diseases

## Febrile Seizures

<!-- febrile seizures path, simple vs complex diagnosis.. -->

- path: fever reduce seizure threshold. Developing brain more vulnerable. Not sure if rate or height of fever matters more
- pt: fever and seizure
	- Simple febrile seizure: 1 in 24 hrs, < 15 min, must be generalized
	- Complex febrile seizure: any 1 of 3 criteria absent

<!-- febrile seizures simple vs complex treatment.. -->

- treatment
	- simple
		- actively seizing: benzo
		- acetaminophen to control fever
		- no imaging needed
		- no antiepileptic drug (not epilepsy)
	- complex
		- EEG: if not sure it's seizure
		- LP: fear of meningitis
		- MRI: better than CT, no radiation. Look for something in brain if not other two
		- Antiepileptic drugs

## Infantile Spasms

<!-- infantile spasm aka, pt, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, f/u -->

- aka West Syndrome
- pt: < 1 yo
- symptoms
	- bilateral symmetrical limb jerking
	- not generalized
	- no fever
- diagnosis
	- interictal EEG show hypsarrythmia
- treatment: ACTH
- f/u
	- cognitive delay, mental retardation
	- part of tuberous sclerosis.,

## Tuberous Sclerosis

<!-- tuberous sclerosis path, pt, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, complications -->

- path: genetic
- Pt: <2 yo
- symptoms: angiofribromas, **ashleaf spot**, afebrile seizures, complex febrile seizures
- diagnosis: neuroimaging, see tubers
- treatment: supportive
- f/u: die young, MR.,

# Absent

<!-- ignore.. -->

- path: hundreds to thousands per day
- pt: ADHD
- symptoms: loc, no loss of tones, generalized, no post ictal state (pt go in and out of seizures, stay up right, don't shake)
- diagnosis: EEG
- treatment: ethusuxomide, valproic
- f/u: outgrow
