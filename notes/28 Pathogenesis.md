- CREATE your own MEAT combo: creatinine is the breakdown product of CREATINE (found in muscle cells)
- Credit card: creatinine (used to measure kidney function)
- “$1 MENU”: creatinine has a normal serum concentration of 1.0 mg/dL (ranging from 0.6 to 1.2)
- “Free filtered”: creatinine is freely filtered at the glomerulus
- “NEVER REABSORBED!”: once in the nephron, creatinine is NOT resorbed and only minorly secreted (Cr filtered load ≈ Cr urinary excretion)
- “\*May contain minor secretions”: creatinine is secreted in small amounts into the nephron → urine conc. is slightly higher than serum conc. (slightly overestimate GFR)
- “Grounds Filter Rate”: glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the amount of fluid that filters across the glomerulus into Bowman’s space (125ml/min)
- Credit card cleared: creatinine clearance can be used to approximate GFR (slight overestimation) because Cr is freely filtered at the glomerulus and is neither secreted (almost!) nor reabsorbed
- “CUP → ”: C=UV/P (creatinine clearance equation used to estimate GFR)
- “100% real”: creatinine clearance (estimation of GFR) is normally >100 ml/min mg/dL (<100 ml/min is abnormal, <10 indicates renal failure)
- Elderly man knocking over filtered coffee: GFR decreases with age (renal dosing of drugs)
- BUN bag: Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) is cleared by the kidney (final breakdown product of nitrogen containing compounds)
- “N” order cycle: BUN comes from the urea cycle in the liver (amino acid metabolism)
- Pyrimidine hexagon titles: BUN also comes pyrimidine metabolism (nitrogenous bases)
- “Order 10": BUN has a normal serum concentration of 10 mg/dL (ranging from 7-20)
- Spilled filtered coffee: a decrease in GFR (renal injury or dysfunction) will cause an increase in BUN
- “Pro Car Track” absorbing BUN grease: once in the nephron BUN is actively reabsorbed at the Proximal Convoluted Tubule
- MEGAKING: Acute Kidney Injury (acute pre-renal, renal, or post-renal azotemia)
- Trickle next to credit card: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) manifests as increased serum creatinine and/or decreased urine output (oliguria)
- Ketchup hemorrhage: hypovolemia or hemorrhage can cause PRE-RENAL AKI (kidney is hypoperfused)
- Failing heart balloon: low output states (e.g. heart failure, shock) can cause PRE-RENAL AKI (kidney is hypoperfused)
- BUN grease reabsorption: urea resorption in the proximal tubule is INCREASED during low perfusion states → INCREASED BUN/Cr ratio (>15)
- Lifted BUN bag over credit card: increased BUN/Cr ratio (>15) in PRE-RENAL AKI
- FENa fries dropping: decreased fractional excretion of sodium (FENa <1%) in PRE-RENAL AKI (sodium is conserved during low perfusion states)
- “UP/UP N away!”: UNaPCr/PNaUCr (FENa equation used to assess ability to reabsorb sodium)
- Pepper in the consOSMents: PRE-RENAL AKI is associated with a  UOsm > 500 (concentrated urine to conserve volume)
- Necrotic chocolate straw: acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the most common cause of INTRINSIC RENAL AKI
- Blue spotted kidney tray: acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) causes INTRINSIC RENAL AKI
- Dripping glomerular curly straw: glomerulonephritis can cause INTRINSIC RENAL AKI
- Falling BUN Bag over Credit card: BUN/Cr ratio <15 in INTRINSIC RENAL AKI (but both BUN and Cr are elevated)
- Elevated FENa fries: FENa is >2% in INTRINSIC RENAL AKI (unable to reabsorb sodium)
- Empty condOSMents bottle: INTRINSIC AKI is associated with a  UOsm <350 (unable to conserve water)
- Elevated BUN bag over Credit card: the BUN/Cre is >15 in POST-RENAL AKI (back-pressure enhances urea reabsorption)
- Obstructive spit balls: bilateral nephrolithiasis can cause POST-RENAL AKI
- BPH Fire hat: benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) can cause POST-RENAL AKI
- Cancer crab buckle: cancer of the ureter, bladder, or urethra can also cause POST-RENAL AKI
- Fallen BUN bag and Credit card: the BUN/Cr ratio can be decreased in severe or prolonged POST-RENAL AKI

# Calcium Oxalate Stones

<!-- renal stones overview cause and treatment. Ca ox stones treatment -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/image-20200825070613953.png)

- Dried up river deposits: all renal stones form due to supersaturation (adequate hydration is cornerstone of treatment)
- Pale thighs: hydrochlorothiazide can help prevent calcium stone formation by increasing reabsorption of calcium in the distal tubule

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/QqQxFuX.jpg)

- Removing tube slide stones: thiazide diuretics can be used to prevent calcium stones (increased calcium reabsorption causes hypocalciuria)

<!-- 2 causes of Ca ox renal stones -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/image-20200825070613953.png)

- Milk dripping into river bed: high concentration of calcium in the renal tubule → calcium stones (calcium oxalate most common)
- Ox in river bed: too much oxalate in the renal tubule → calcium oxalate stones
- Milk dripping from udders: hypercalciuria (e.g. idiopathic, or due to hypercalcemia, chronic acidosis) can cause calcium stones

<!-- hypercalciuria calcium ox stone causes -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/image-20200825070613953.png)

- Normal milk bucket: hypercalciuria with normocalcemia → calcium stones
- First place dairy cow: hypercalciuria with normocalcemia is the most common metabolic abnormality causing calcium stones
- GI cow spot: absorptive hypercalciuria (excessive gut absorption of calcium) is the most common cause of hypercalciuria with normocalcemia
- Leaking kidney milk bucket: renal hypercalciuria (defect in proximal reabsorption of calcium) can cause hypercalciuria with normocalcemia
- Bone cow spot: resorptive hypercalciuria (excess resorption of calcium from the bone) can cause hypercalciuria with normocalcemia
- Elevated milk buckets: hypercalcemia (e.g. due to PHPT, cancer) can cause hypercalciuria and calcium stones

<!-- pH, citrate, and calcium ox stones -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/image-20200825070613953.png)

- Acid on bones: acidosis can cause hypercalciuria and calcium stones (calcium-phosphate buffer system)
- Citrus crate with milk: citrate binds calcium in the renal tubules (soluble complex prevents stone formation
- Acid miners: acidosis can cause calcium stones (due to hypocitraturia)
- Acid miner grabbing citrus crate: acidemia promotes resorption of citrate from tubule → less citrate bound to calcium in tubule → calcium stones

<!-- other causes of calcium ox stones -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/image-20200825070613953.png)

- Spewing mud: diarrhea can cause calcium stones (due to volume depletion, and acidemia with hypocitraturia)
- Meat eater: high protein diets can cause calcium stones (acidemia causes hypocitraturia)
- Crushed citrus crate: vitamin C deficiency can cause calcium stones (due to hypocirtaturia)
- Cow eating salty peanuts: increased dietary sodium intake can cause calcium stones (reduced Na+ and Ca2+ reabsorption in the nephron through their symporter)
- Milk collecting in damaged GI path: fat malabsorption (e.g. Crohn's, short gut) binds calcium in the gut → GI absorption of unbound oxalate → calcium oxalate stones

<!-- oxalate and calcium ox stones -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/image-20200825070613953.png)

- Spilling milk: decreased dietary calcium promotes calcium oxalate stone formation (due to increased GI absorption of unbound oxalate)
- Oxen stampede: increased oxalate GI absorption (e.g. due to decreased dietary Ca2+, vegan diet, malabsorption) promotes calcium oxalate stone formation
- Ox eating plants: pure vegan diets (without calcium supplementation) can cause calcium oxalate stones

<!-- calcium phosphate stones causes -->

- Fossil mining kids: calcium phosphate stones are the most common stone found in children
- Acid cylinder: type 1 renal tubular acidosis (RTA) promotes calcium phosphate stone formation (acidemia, plus alkaline urine environment). Can also form with hyperparathyroidism
- Elevated “pH” shape: alkaline urine environment promotes calcium pHosphate stone formation
