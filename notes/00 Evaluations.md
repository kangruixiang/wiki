# 00 Evaluations

- Enthusiastic.  If a task is assigned to her, she will get it finished. Saves interns huge amount of time with phone calls and gathering information.
- Excellent knowledge base. Forming her own differentials and assessment/plan. Functioning at level of intern in many patient cases.
- Curious learner. Will look up articles and help teach the interns in the afternoons.
- Excellent social awareness. Understand her role as a student fully. Does not overstep boundaries. An essential skill to have, this will make her an incredible intern.
- Self improving. Will read up on patients herself even if it's not her patient. Continuously working on dynamics within team without overstepping boundaries.
- Good presentation skill. Has all the details about the patient, both subjective and objective

Next step as student:

- Rely less on notes when presenting. Start with really knowing a patient's problem list. The rest will fall in place. Ideally notes are references for objective data
- Offer to help more with small tasks with residents. Can really save a lot of their time
- Continuously work on having good team dynamics, a difficult skill but essential for residents. You will get a taste of it next year as AI when you have your own 3rd year students
- Continue to read up on patients and their disease pathologies. The amount of knowledge isn't important but the habit every day will decide the capability as a resident and beyond.
- Work on forming own problem list with assessment and plan.
- Overall, excellent job on the service!
