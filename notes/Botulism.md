**Infant botulism** is a flaccid neuropathy that occurs in children age <1 following the ingestion of **_Clostridium botulinum_** **spores**.  These spores are typically found in honey as well as environmental  dust/soil, particularly in rural or farm areas where the soil is  frequently disturbed. Although ingestion of the spores is unlikely to  harm a healthy adult, infants have an immature digestive system that  lacks protective enteric microbiota. Therefore, the spores are able to  colonize the gastrointestinal tract and produce toxin in situ. This  neurotoxin **inhibits presynaptic acetylcholine release** into the **neuromuscular junction**, causing dysfunction of the skeletal and smooth muscles.

Nonspecific early manifestations include **constipation** and poor feeding, as seen in this infant. Over time patients develop oculobulbar weakness, which may result in **ptosis**, impaired pupillary constriction, poor suck, and/or absent gag reflex. Muscle weakness can progress to **descending paralysis** and respiratory failure. Neurologic examination reveals symmetric **hypotonia**, diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes, and decreased strength.

Acetylcholine receptor antibodies in the neuromuscular junction are implicated in myasthenia gravis. Ptosis is a common presenting symptom; however, constipation is not associated, and a slow progression of  fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue is characteristic.

**Intravenous botulism immune globulin** (BIG-IV) is the  treatment for infant botulism and should be administered as early as  possible in the course of the illness to reduce the severity and  duration of symptoms. It is given once the diagnosis is suspected and  should not be delayed while awaiting confirmatory stool studies. Close  monitoring of respiratory status is also required and is typically  performed in an intensive care setting in case of any sudden  deterioration. Supportive care includes laxatives for constipation and  nasogastric feeds for poor suck. Infants often require hospitalization  for a few months; however, a **full recovery** is expected with BIG-IV.
