| total protein | SAAG > 1.1            | SAAG < 1.1         |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| < 2.5         | cirrhosis, portal HTN | nephrotic syndrome |
| > 2.5         | cardiac, budd chiari  | cancer             |

- SAAG > 1.1: portal HTN
	- TP > 2.5: cardiac
	- TP < 2.5: cirrhotic
- if TP < 1.5: less complement, less immunity, assume SBP
- SBP: signs of renal dysfunction, bad systemic function (bili > 3, Child pugh > 9)
- portal vein => (1) hepatic vein => heart
  1. sinusoids, protein from heart. Pressure pushes out protein, so higher protein
	- in cirrhosis, fibrosis prevents outflow, so lower total protein
