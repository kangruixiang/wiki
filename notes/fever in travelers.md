<!-- fever in traveler ddx -->

The differential diagnosis for fever in a returning  traveler depends on geographic epidemiology and is often divided into 3  categories (with some overlap):

- Early incubation period (<10 days) infections include typhoid fever, dengue fever, chikungunya, influenza, and legionellosis
- Medium incubation period (1-3 weeks) infections include malaria, typhoid  fever, leptospirosis, schistosomiasis, and rickettsial disease
- Longer incubation period (>3 weeks) infections include tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, and enteric parasitic infections.
