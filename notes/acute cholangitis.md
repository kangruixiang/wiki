- pathogenesis:
	- common bile duct ascending bacterial infection
	- result of choledocholithiasis: disruption of normal bile flow, bacteria ascend biliary tract from duodenum
- cause:
	- E. coli (25 to 50%)
	- Klebsiella pneumonia (15 to 20%)
	- Enterobacter_ species (5 to 10%)
	- Enterococcus_ species (10 to 20%)
	- Bacteroides_ and Clostridia (anaerobes, usually part of a mixed infection)
- sx:
	- **charcot triad**: RUQ, fever, jaundice
	- reynolds pentad: hypotension, AMS. Indicative of **suppurative cholangitis** due to septic shock
- labs:
	- leukocytosis
	- cholestatic liver function test
- imaging
	- US RUQ: biliary duct dilation without gas in biliary tree
	- emphysematous cholecystitis: gas in biliary tree
- treatment
	- IVF, blood cultures, abx
		- zosyn or cipro with flagyl

	- biliary drainage with ERCP in 24-48 hours

	- if not possible, percutaneous cholangiography with biliary tube placement

	- Elective cholecystectomy in 2 weeks to prevent future episodes
