- Patients with asymptomatic mild thrombocytopenia (platelets >30,000/µL without bleeding) can generally be observed without treatment.
- **Corticosteroids** are a first-line treatment option for patients with symptoms and/or a platelet count of <30,000/µL; the majority of adults respond within 1-2 weeks.
- **Intravenous immunoglobulin** can be considered in patients who have failed or have contraindications to steroid therapy or require a more rapid increase in platelet counts.
- **Anti-Rh(D)** is an alternate treatment option in rhesus-positive non-splenectomized patients.
- **Rituximab** can be considered for patients who have failed initial treatment.  Splenectomy is generally reserved for refractory cases .
