**Febrile neutropenia** is generally defined as a temperature >38.3 C (>101 F) and an ==absolute neutrophil count <500/mm3==.  Most cases are due to gram-positive pathogens such as ==_Staphylococcus epidermidis_== (most common), _Staphylococcus aureus_, and streptococci, but gram-negative bacteria (eg, _Pseudomonas_) are isolated in approximately 25% of cases and are often associated with more severe illness.

Monotherapy with an **anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam** (eg, **piperacillin-tazobactam**, cefepime) or a carbapenem is considered first-line treatment in the inpatient setting.  Studies have shown no improvement in mortality with the routine addition of a second agent (eg, vancomycin) targeting gram-positive pathogens.  Indications for ==vancomycin== include:

- Hemodynamic instability
- Severe sepsis
- Pneumonia
- Positive blood cultures for a gram-positive organism (prior to speciation results)
- Suspected catheter-related infection (eg, chills during infusion, cellulitis around entry site)
- Skin or soft-tissue infection
