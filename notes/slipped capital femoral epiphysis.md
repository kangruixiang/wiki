# slipped capital femoral epiphysis

- related: [[Pediatric]]

SCFE

- pt: overweight adolescents, AA, hypothyroidism, down syndrome, or thin pt with rapid growth spurt
- cause:
	- slippage of epiphysis relative to metaphysis at growth plate
	- **Cartilage in the hypertrophic zone** acts as the weak point where the slippage occurs.
- symptoms:
	- presents with a limp. Pain when moving hips
	- **thigh and groin** pain, knee pain
	- **Trendelenburg gait**
	- external rotation in passive hip flexion (limited hip flexion)
	- limited hip internal rotation and abduction
- dx:
	- xray: AP and frog leg showing **the epiphysis remaining within the acetabulum while the neck displaces anteriorly and externally rotates leaving the head posterior to the neck.** An early radiographic finding is epiphysiolysis where the growth plate is widened or shows increased lucency

### Treatment

Treatment options are **primarily surgical** with percutaneous pinning of the slipped side. Treatment of this condition is emergent.

**Prophylactic pinning of the non-slipped side** should be considered in cases of slipped capital femoral epiphysis related to hypothyroidism.
