**Nonaccidental trauma** (NAT), or  child abuse, occurs most frequently in infants age <1. Delayed  presentation to medical care is typical, and red flags for abuse include a vague history of injury and a supposed mechanism that is inconsistent with the child's development. Siblings or pets are also commonly  blamed for the injury.

Certain fracture patterns are warning signs of abuse. A **femur fracture** in a nonambulating child, particularly a spiral fracture as seen in this patient, is suspicious for a twisting force on the  thigh. The reported mechanism of injury in this case is unlikely, as  most 18-month-olds can run but not jump off a couch. Furthermore, the  sibling's weight is likely not sufficient for a direct fall to result in a fracture; if it were, a transverse fracture would be expected. In addition, the sibling's history of **digital fractures** is concerning for inflicted injury by door slamming. Other fractures  that are virtually pathognomonic for NAT include posterior rib  fractures, metaphyseal corner ("bucket-handle") fractures, and fractures at various stages of healing.

Given this patient's presentation and x-ray findings, a complete **skeletal survey**, fundoscopy, and CT scan of the head are necessary to evaluate for other fractures, retinal hemorrhages, and intracranial injury (eg, subdural  hematoma).

Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), an autosomal dominant disorder  characterized by an increased tumor susceptibility (eg, neurofibromas,  optic gliomas), presents with >6 caf√©-au-lait macules. This  patient's 3 small macules are normal.  In addition, there is no  suggestion of a positive family history for NF1.

Osteogenesis imperfecta, due to defective type 1  collagen, causes fractures, retinal hemorrhages, and bruising similar to NAT. However, patients typically have multiple fractures in the  neonatal period and blue sclera, not present in this case.

Osteomalacia, soft bones due to decreased bone mineralization, can be  caused by rickets (vitamin D deficiency) in children. Pathologic  fractures are common, but epiphyseal widening, metaphyseal cupping, and  osteopenia are expected on radiograph.
