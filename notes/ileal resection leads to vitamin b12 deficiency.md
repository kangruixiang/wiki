<!-- ileal resection malnutrition result, treatment -->

==Ileal section leads to vitamin B12 deficiency==, ==bile salt malabsorption== (subsequent malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins), and ==secretory diarrhea==.  The secretory diarrhea is due to ==malabsorbed bile acids entering the colon== causing colonic stimulation; ==cholestyramine== lessens this process by binding the bile acids.  Treatment for patients with ileal resection also involves ==supplementation of vitamin B12== and other fat-soluble vitamins.
