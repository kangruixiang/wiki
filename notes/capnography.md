**Capnography** is the measurement of the partial pressure of CO2 in the exhaled breath over time.  The maximum CO2 concentration at the end of each tidal breath (end-tidal, ET CO2) can provide information about ventilation and perfusion in patients in cardiac arrest undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

The increase in cardiac output with the **return of spontaneous circulation** (ROSC) causes rapid transport of CO2 accumulated in tissues during cardiac arrest to the lungs.  This is detected as a **sudden rise in EtCO2** on capnography and is the earliest indicator of ROSC, occurring even before a pulse can be palpated.  This technology virtually eliminates the need to stop CPR to check for a palpable pulse, reducing interruptions in cardiac compressions.

In addition, recent studies have indicated that EtCO2 can help determine prognosis during cardiac arrest.  Patients with an EtCO2 of ≤10 mm Hg after 20 minutes of CPR are highly unlikely to achieve ROSC.
