# RSV

<!-- bronchiolitis cause, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, complications -->

This patient's clinical presentation is most consistent with **bronchiolitis**, an infection that occurs in the winter and is most commonly caused by **respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)**. Patients typically have nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, coarse breath sounds, and **wheezing** with or without **crackles**.  Other common features include a low-grade fever, increased work of  breathing with accessory muscle use (eg, retractions), nasal flaring,  and grunting. Respiratory symptoms may interfere with feeding and  increase the risk of dehydration.

**Bronchiolitis** is generally **diagnosed clinically**.  Classic features include an upper respiratory prodrome of rhinorrhea,  nasal congestion, and cough, followed 2-3 days later by lower airway  signs of wheezing and increased work of breathing. Antigen testing of  nasal or pulmonary secretions **(Choice A)** or nucleic  acid amplification testing is used to detect breakthrough respiratory  syncytial virus (RSV) infection among infants who receive palivizumab  prophylaxis.

Patients with respiratory distress, apnea, hypoxia, and/or dehydration should be hospitalized on **contact and droplet precautions** to prevent nosocomial spread of this extremely contagious virus. Therapy generally consists of **supportive** measures, such as intravenous fluids, nasal bulb suctioning, and/or  humidified oxygen. Inhaled bronchodilators used to be recommended, but  this is no longer the case as current evidence shows that they do not  reduce illness duration, admission rates, or length of hospital stay.

Antibiotics have no role in the treatment of bronchiolitis unless there  is concern for coexisting bacterial pneumonia (eg, high fever, focal  crackles on auscultation, consolidation on chest x-ray).

Systemic corticosteroids are not recommended for first-time  bronchiolitis due to the lack of evidence of clinical effect.  Corticosteroids can be considered in patients with recurrent wheezing or asthma exacerbation.

RSV is associated with the development of **recurrent wheezing** in up to 30% of patients. Patient should be advised to avoid other  triggers of airway reactivity, particularly exposure to secondhand  cigarette smoke.
