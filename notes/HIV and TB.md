# HIV and TB

- related: [[HIV]], [[ID]], [[immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome]]

<!-- positive TB pts in HIV management, watch out for, dx, rx -->

- IRIS common in TB patients with HIV
- interferon gamma poor indicator of active TB
- might not mount response to have positive interferon gamma
- treat with rifabutin over rifampin

The timing of his presentation is consistent with the [[immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome]] (IRIS) (median 48 days), the return of a robust immune response resulting from treatment of the HIV that “unmasks” a pre-existing infection that appears like a new acute infection. This presentation is common with tuberculosis, which may present as a much more acute pulmonary illness resembling bacterial pneumonia. He had an indeterminate result on interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) because of an inadequate response to the positive control, which was the result of immunocompromise at the time of presentation; additionally, the results of IGRA testing are a poor indicator of active tuberculosis infection. He should begin four-drug antituberculous therapy while results of culture and susceptibility testing are pending. Nucleic acid amplification testing of the specimen may give information on the identification of the organisms and even the possibility of rifamycin resistance. Initial empiric treatment for tuberculosis should include a rifamycin as one of the four drugs, but rifabutin is often preferred over rifampin in patients with HIV because of fewer drug-drug interactions between rifabutin and antiretrovirals, including dolutegravir.

If this patient does have active tuberculosis, treatment is needed urgently; culture results may take weeks, so waiting would be inappropriate.

Antiretrovirals should not be stopped when IRIS occurs. Therapy should be continued while providing treatment for the newly diagnosed infection.

Prednisone can be added if IRIS is life threatening or involves the pericardium or central nervous system. None of these is the case in this patient; giving glucocorticoids without a known diagnosis increases the risk of worsening an infection that is not being directly treated.

Reactivation of latent tuberculosis is also significantly increased in HIV infection, even without a decreased CD4 cell count. Tuberculosis is also more likely to present in extrapulmonary sites or with an atypical chest radiograph. Tuberculosis treatment in HIV must consider interactions of rifamycins with many antiretrovirals.

<!-- A 25-year-old man is evaluated in the emergency department for fever, productive cough, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain that began several days ago. He reports no other symptoms. Intravenous ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin are initiated, and he is hospitalized. Medical history is significant for a recent diagnosis of HIV infection, for which he began antiretroviral therapy 1 month ago. Other medications are lamivudine, abacavir, and dolutegravir.

On physical examination, temperature is 39.2 °C (102.6 °F), blood pressure is 136/84 mm Hg, pulse rate is 110/min, and respiration rate is 20/min. Oxygen saturation is 90% breathing ambient air. Cardiac examination is normal, and the lungs are clear bilaterally.

Laboratory studies at the time of HIV diagnosis showed a viral load of 95,420 copies/mL and CD4 cell count of 256/µL. The interferon-γ release assay for tuberculosis was indeterminate because of inadequate response to the positive control. One week ago, HIV viral load was 1077 copies/mL and CD4 cell count was 313/µL.

A chest radiograph shows an infiltrate in the right middle lobe and bilateral hilar enlargement.
