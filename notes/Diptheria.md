This young patient who did not receive  age-appropriate vaccinations has fever, sore throat, and pharyngeal grey patches coalescing into a pseudomembrane, suggesting **diphtheria** infection.

Diphtheria is caused by **toxigenic strains** of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, a gram-positive bacillus transmitted via respiratory secretions that largely affects children **age <15**.  Exotoxin released by the bacteria is absorbed systemically and can  result in dose-dependent damage to the heart, nervous system, and  kidneys. **Myocarditis** occurs in up to two-thirds of patients; severe cases are associated with complete heart block and heart failure.

Vaccination with **diphtheria toxoid** significantly reduces the likelihood of infection with toxigenic  strains of diphtheria; this not only reduces the risk of developing  active infection but also limits asymptomatic carriage of toxigenic  strains (causing population-wide declines in prevalence).
