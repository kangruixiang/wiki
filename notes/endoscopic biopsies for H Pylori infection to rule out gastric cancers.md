This patient presents with symptoms of peptic ulcer disease likely from _Helicobacter pylori_ infection, a common cause of gastric and duodenal ulcers.  Peptic ulcer disease is also strongly associated with gastric cancers (40%) and primarily gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas.  _H pylori_ infection also can lead to chronic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia and is more common in individuals from East Asia and certain parts of Latin America.  Thus, obtaining ==multiple biopsies for histology== is generally recommended.

Eradication of _H pylori_ (triple-based therapy) also appears to reduce the risk of gastric cancer in certain high-risk individuals.  Endoscopy may be repeated in 6 weeks after completion of therapy if the ulcer biopsy was inadequate or in patients at high risk for malignancy (Table).
