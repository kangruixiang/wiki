<!-- pneumonia bird association -->

Chlamydia psittaci is the causative agent of psittacosis, which typically presents as pneumonia associated with abrupt onset of fever, severe headache, and dry cough. This organism is associated with inhalation of dried bird droppings, so bird owners or breeders and poultry farmers are at particularly high risk for this infection.
