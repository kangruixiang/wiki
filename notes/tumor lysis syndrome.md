**Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)** occurs when a ==large tumor burden undergoes rapid destruction== with release of its intracellular contents into the bloodstream.  Resulting electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities can cause ==acute kidney injury== (eg, ==calcium-phosphate precipitation== in renal tubules), ==arrhythmias== (eg, ==calcium-phosphate precipitation in the heart==), ==seizures==, and possible sudden ==cardiac death==.  TLS is defined by >**2** of the following:

- Uric acid >8.0 mg/dL (or 25% ↑ in baseline value \[BV])
- Potassium >6.0 mEq/L (or 25% ↑ in BV)
- Phosphorus >4.5 mg/dL (or 25% ↑ in BV)
- Calcium <7.0 mg/dL (or 25% ↓ in BV)

Strategies for TLS prevention are dependent on risk stratification (Table).  Low-risk patients need only hydration with close monitoring, whereas intermediate-risk patients may receive hydration and allopurinol.  **High-risk patients** should receive intravenous hydration and **5-7 days** of prophylactic **rasburicase**, a recombinant uric acid oxidase that immediately catalyzes uric acid conversion into water-soluble allantoin and rapidly lowers uric acid levels.

Although this high-risk patient (with acute myeloblastic leukemia with leukocytosis >100,000/mm3) received appropriate prophylactic therapy, she has elevated phosphorus and potassium as well as worsening renal function, concerning for impending TLS development.  She should receive aggressive **intravenous hydration** with a urine output goal of **>80-100 mL/hr** as this helps decrease formation of uric acid and calcium-phosphate crystals.

==Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase to prevent formation of uric acid== and ==requires 3-4 days to become fully effective==; it does not lower the preexisting uric acid levels.  Regardless, this patient's uric acid level has already decreased, indicating that rasburicase was effective and should be continued.
