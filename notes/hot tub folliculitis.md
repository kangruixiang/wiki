# hot tub folliculitis

- related: [[Dermatology]]

**Folliculitis** is characterized by the formation of **erythematous papules** or **pustules** around hair follicles.  Lesions tend to arise quickly and are often **pruritic** or painful.  Most cases are due to bacterial infection with _Staphylococcus aureus_ or gram-negative bacteria.  The history and location of lesions can often help determine the likely inciting cause.

This patient who swam in a resort pool likely developed hot tub folliculitis due to _**Pseudomonas aeruginosa**_ infection.  This form of folliculitis develops in the distribution of a wet bathing suit (eg, buttocks, upper thighs) 8-48 hours after swimming in contaminated water.  Antimicrobial treatment is typically unnecessary as most patients recover spontaneously within 7-10 days.  However, patients should be advised to practice good skin hygiene and **avoid continued exposure to contaminated water**.
