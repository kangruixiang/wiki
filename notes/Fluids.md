# Fluids

Questions

- Does pt need IVF
- what type of IVF
- if no longer need, what is maintenance

# Symptoms

Symptoms of hypovolemia:

- low bp
- tachycardia: best indicator for hypovolemia but not response
- low urine output: best for response for resuscitation. 35 cc/hr good for 70 kg adult
- orthostatic hypotension
- BUN/creatinine: greater than 20
- altered mental status
- hypernatremia: advanced
- hyponatremia: early
- osmolarity, FeNa
- weight loss
- CR delayed
- acidosis, contraction alkalosis

# Requirements

- 35 ml/kg/day requirements
- weigh more than 20 kg, 60 + kg

# Resusiscation Indicator

- pulse: 100-120
- good urinary output
- clearance of lactate
- resolution of base deficit: look at bicarb before and after surgery. Usually mildly lower after surgery.

# Management

- hemorrhaging: blood products
- if no hemorrhage: IV fluids (crystalloids/isotonic: NS, LR)
- Give 3 L for every 1 L loss. 2/3 goes to third space
	- bowel wall: ileus
	- lung: pulmonary edema
	- heart: CHF

## Maintenance

**Maintenance IVF**: D5, 1/2NS + 20 meq KCL at 125cc/hr

- dextrose: slow down depletion of glycogen before catabolic state
- diabetics: still use sugar. Give dextrose
- KCl: cardio protection

## LR vs NS

- NS: mildly acidotic. Pure gastric outlet obstruction, use NS instead of LR.
- LR: acidotic, but has bicarb for buffer. Lactate cleared by liver into bicarb once fluid is restored. Better for patients that can easily be fixed. Also looks closer to plasma

# Acid/Base

- improve ventilation (CO2): respiratory rate, tidal volume
- improve oxygenation (O2): FiO2 (immediate) + PEEP (takes time)
