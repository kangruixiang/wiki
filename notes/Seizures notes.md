# Seizures notes

## Pathogenesis

- definition: hypersynchronous firings of brain
- Midbrain: ARAS responsible for consciousness
- Consciousness can be affected by either ARAS or both cerebral cortex problems

## Demographics

- infant: glucose
- elderly: stroke

## Triggers

- light
	- fire
	- Sun on water
- causes: stroke, tumor, meningits, metabolic

## Symptoms

- mimic seizures
	- kids
		- breath holding, behavior staring, temper tantrums, behavioral outbursts
	- syncope
	- syncopal seizures
	- panic attack
	- psychogenic
	- complex migraine: often with basilar symptoms
- PE: sequential events worsens
- Important: first symptoms, second symptoms
- syncope: global ischemia of brain and transient LOC
	- arrythmia: afib
	- reflex bradycardia from treating afib
	- outflow: stenosis
	- dysautonomia: arteries don't constrict. HR don't increase
		- Diabetes common cause
	- hypovolemia
- Epilepsy
	- recurrent under normal conditions
- seizures early: encephalitis
- seizures later: meningitis
- recurrent episodes of unexplained confuseion with spontaneous recover usually result of epileptic seizures
- fake: flopping, have to hold down, punching (directed behaviors), vague episodes, pelvic thrusting, back arching

# Focal Seizures

- focal spikes on EEG
- temporal lobe: deja vu (hippocampus), smell (olfactory), fear/rising sensations in stomach (amygdala), auditory (auditory cx)
- complex partial seizures most common in adults
- aura: simple partial seizure creating hallucinations that rest of brain perceives

# Tonic Clonic

- spikes everywhere
- tonic: rigid, stiffen, drew up
- clonic: jerking
- epileptic 'cry': diaphragm contracts
- postictal confusion

# Treatment

- ethusuxomide not used for partial
