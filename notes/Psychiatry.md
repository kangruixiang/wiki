# Personality Disorders

## Histrionic and borderline

<!-- histrionic disorder characteristics, difference from borderline -->

- Pattern of excessive emotionality & attention-seeking behavior since early adulthood
- Inappropriate, sexually seductive or provocative behavior; uses appearance to draw attention
- Shallow, shifting, dramatic emotions
- Impressionistic, vague speech
- Suggestible (easily influenced)
- Considers relationships more intimate than they really are

This patient's vague description of symptoms, use of appearance to  attract attention, dramatic but shallow and shifting emotions regarding  the romantic breakup, and continued inappropriate familiarity and  seductive behavior toward the physician are suggestive of **histrionic personality disorder**.  Patients with histrionic personality disorder exhibit excessive  emotionality and may attempt to manipulate the physician-patient  relationship through seduction and dramatic descriptions of new symptoms at each visit. This patient's eagerness to move on to more exciting  romantic opportunities and disappointment after not receiving attention  are also characteristic of this disorder. Histrionic personality  disorder should be differentiated from borderline, dependent, and  narcissistic personality disorders, but these can also co-occur.

Individuals with borderline personality disorder can also exhibit  attention seeking, manipulative behavior, and rapidly shifting  emotions. However, this patient does not exhibit self-injurious and  suicidal behavior, intense anger, chronic feelings of emptiness, and  identity disturbance, which would be expected in borderline personality  disorder.

## Steroids

<!-- steroids psych disorder -->

This patient's new onset of **mood symptoms** is most likely due to **corticosteroid** use. **High doses** of prednisone (>40 mg/day), often given for allergic, inflammatory, or autoimmune  conditions (such as systemic lupus erythematosis), may cause psychiatric symptoms in a dose-dependent fashion, with or without any history of  underlying psychiatric disorders. **Longer duration** of  use can increase the risk; however, psychiatric symptoms secondary to  corticosteroids may begin at any time during the course of treatment.  Corticosteroid-induced psychiatric symptoms are more common in women  than in men. In addition to mood symptoms, **psychosis** and **anxiety** can also occur. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in patients taking glucocorticoids include **sleep disturbances**, **restlessness**, and memory loss.

Whenever possible, the first step in the treatment of corticosteroid-induced psychiatric symptoms is **dose reduction** (or discontinuation if appropriate) of the offending medication. Once  the corticosteroid has been reduced, then psychiatric symptoms can be  treated if they persist.

## MDD

<!-- MDD treatment duration -->

This patient has a first episode of major depression that has responded to acute treatment with citalopram. To reduce the  risk of depressive relapse, guidelines recommend that patients with a **single episode** of **major depressive disorder** should **continue antidepressant** treatment for approximately **6 months following acute response** (referred to as "continuation phase treatment"). The dosage that  achieved response should be maintained and not reduced (ie, the dose  that gets the patient well keeps the patient well) **(Choice A)**.

Patients with a history of multiple episodes (recurrent major depressive  disorder), chronic episodes (≥2 years), strong family history, or severe episodes (eg, suicide attempt) should be considered for maintenance  treatment. This typically involves continuing antidepressant medication for 1-3 years following remission to reduce the risk of recurrence **(Choice D)**.  Patients with a history of highly recurrent (eg, ≥3 lifetime episodes)  and very severe, chronic major depressive episodes may need to continue  maintenance treatment indefinitely.

## Lithium

<!-- lithium and suicide -->

Randomized, controlled trials support the use of **lithium** as either monotherapy or augmentation in **preventing suicide**.  Its protective effect may result from treating or preventing mood episodes and/or decreasing impulsivity and aggression.

## Therapies

<!--  DBT vs interpersonal vs psychodynamic vs exposure and response -->

**Exposure and response prevention therapy**, a specific form of **cognitive-behavioral therapy** (CBT), is considered **first-line** psychotherapy for OCD. Exposure and response prevention therapy  involves gradual and repetitive exposure to anxiety-provoking stimuli  that produce obsessional thoughts (eg, contamination fears), followed by prevention of performing the associated compulsion or ritual (eg,  compulsive cleaning, repetitive showers).

Dialectical behavioral therapy is a form of CBT developed for the treatment of borderline personality disorder.

Interpersonal psychotherapy focuses on improving dysfunctional  relationships and interpersonal functioning. It is used primarily in  the treatment of depressive disorders.

Psychodynamic psychotherapy, which traces problems back to their  origins in childhood, may provide the patient with insight but is not  effective in changing the compulsive behaviors seen in OCD.

## Acute Grief

This patient's tearfulness, insomnia, poor appetite, weight loss,  hallucinations of her recently deceased husband, and wish that she had  died instead are consistent with **normal grief**.  Acute grief shares many symptoms with major depression (eg, sadness,  anhedonia, sleep and appetite disturbance, impaired concentration), but  the sadness is less persistent and does not involve low self-esteem,  excessive guilt, or active suicidal ideation. **Management** of **acute grief** includes expressing **empathy, education** about the range of typical grief symptoms, and **monitoring**.  Patients without mental disorders should be reassured that transient  hallucinations are also consistent with acute grief and are not  psychotic.

The patient's transient hallucinations and illusions are part of normal  grief and do not require treatment with an antipsychotic.

Uncomplicated acute grief does not require treatment and is generally managed with  support from family, friends, and clergy. Benzodiazepines have not been shown to be helpful and are not recommended **(Choice B)**. Psychotherapy is generally unnecessary and should not be routinely offered **(Choice C)**.  For patients with insomnia, a behavioral approach (eg, sleep hygiene)  is the recommended initial intervention. Hypnotic medications are  reserved for patients unresponsive to behavioral interventions.
