# 05 Spleen

<!-- what is lymph, drains where -->

# Lymphoid Organs

<!-- primary vs secondary lymph organs and function -->

<!-- Lymph node components. 3 layers. Where does lymph go in and out -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/wyg4YrY.jpg)

- Cortex: white, contains **follicle**
- Paracortex: T cells
- Medulla with cords and sinus
- Afferent lymph goes through the 3 layers, exit at 1 efferent vessel

<!-- lymph node function. How does it happen. End result -->

- APC process free antigens

## Cortex

<!-- what and where are lymphoid follicles. Function, contains what cells. Why are they important in HIV -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/7Fsdf40.jpg)

- dendritic cell like velcro picking up antigens that allow B cell to react

<!-- primary vs secondary lymphoid follicles -->

- 4: follicle
- 3: white, germinal center, thus secondary follicle

## Paracortex

<!-- Paracortex contains what cells. Classic disorder. How does it respond during infection. What's so special about the venules -->

- HEV: spaces between endothelium to allow B and T from blood to enter lymph

## Medulla

<!-- 2 parts of the medulla, contains what cells, function. -->

# Spleen

<!-- spleen function, does not do what -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/Msib0GJ.jpg)

- not lymph filter
- filters blood
- everything in blood enters spleen

<!-- Spleen components, functions in each -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/YVAvrsf.jpg)

- first from artery to white pulp (white)
- then blood moves through red section, red pulp
- eventually back to splenic vein

## White Pulp

<!-- white pulp components. Cells in each -->

## Red Pulp

<!-- red pulp contains, cells -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/nSFaYUX.jpg)

- endothelium with barrel hoop membrane. Still large enough for blood to pass through

<!-- Splenic dysfunction infection risk. MOA -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/Q1PKHLb.jpg)

- less complement activity because needs IgG and IgM for binding Fc

![](https://i.imgur.com/TufFaYk.jpg)

- antibody binding leads to MAC and c3b formation
- macrophage binds to antibody and c3b, phagocytosis

<!-- common splenic dysfunction organisms -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/1sMAJ3S.jpg)

- malaria/babesia: infected RBC can't be cleared

<!-- splenic dysfunction cause -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/LME2B1s.jpg)

- ITP: low platelets. Take out spleen to increase platelet
- spherocytosis: take spleen out, less destruction of anemia
- Sickle cell: so many abnormal RBC that damages spleen when removed

<!-- splenic dysfunction histology RBCs -->

- target cells usually cleared by spleen
