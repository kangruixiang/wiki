**Subclinical hypothyroidism** (SCH) is defined as an **elevated serum TSH** level with a **normal free thyroxine**.  The most common cause is chronic lymphocytic [[Hashimoto thyroiditis]].  The decision to treat SCH with levothyroxine depends on the magnitude of TSH elevation, age, presence of goiter, and whether there are symptoms definitely attributable to hypothyroidism.  In addition, high circulating levels of **anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO)** antibodies (seen in >90% of patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis) are associated with **progression to overt hypothyroidism** and can identify patients who are likely to benefit from treatment.

This patient has a mild TSH elevation and nonspecific symptoms (eg, fatigue, weight loss followed by weight gain), some of which could be attributable to medications (eg, topiramate).  Measuring the level of anti-TPO antibodies would help establish the diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis and facilitate management decisions

**Subclinical hypothyroidism** is associated with an increased risk for a number of pregnancy complications, including **recurrent miscarriages**, severe preeclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight, and placental abruption.  In addition, anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies are associated with increased risk for pregnancy loss, even in women who are biochemically euthyroid.  Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism associated with high titers of anti-TPO antibodies may reduce the risk of recurrent miscarriages.
