# Testicular Pathology

<!-- Germ Cell Tumors of the testicle demographics, epidemiology -->

Most common type of testicular tumor (>95% of cases), and they usually occur between 15-40 years of age.

<!-- testicular germ cell tumors symptoms -->

Patients will often present with a **firm testicular mass that cannot be transilluminated**. (hypoechoic)

<!-- Germ cell tumors of the testicle classification -->

Can be classified as one of the following types:

- **Seminoma** (55% of cases) are highly responsive to radiotherapy, metastasize late, and have an excellent prognosis. 
- **Nonseminomas** (45% of cases) show variable response to treatment and often metastasize early
	- Yolk sac tumors
	- Embryonal carcinoma and teratoma
	- Choriocarcinoma.

<!-- Germ cell tumor tumor markers -->

Tumor markers:

- Yolk sac: high AFP
- Choriocarcinoma: high b-HCG
- embryonal, teratoma: high AFP or b-HCG
- seminoma: high ALP and rarely HCG..

<!-- Germ Cell Tumors of testicle risks -->

The risk factors for germ cell tumors of the testicle include the following:

- **Cryptorchidism** (most common)
- \*\*Androgen Insensitivity \*\*
- **Family history of testicular cancer**
- \*\*Down Syndrome  \*\*
- **Klinefelter syndrome**.

<!-- Testicular cancer diagnosis -->

The diagnosis of testicular cancer is often made with **ultrasound**, which reveals a **hypoechoic intratesticular mass**..

## Seminoma

<!-- Seminoma epidemiology, originates from -->

The **most common testicular tumor** (40%) that originates in the germinal epithelium or the seminiferous tubules.; resembles ovarian dysgerminoma.

<!-- Seminomas histology and gross -->

On histology will reveal **clear, polygonal germ cells with round nuclei and prominent nucleoli** that are arranged into lobules and surrounded by septa. There is often a **lymphocytic infiltrate** and granulomas. Grossly these tumors appear as a bulky, gray tumor _without_ hemorrhage or necrosis.

<!-- Testicular seminomas symptoms -->

Most commonly present with **painless testicular enlargement**.

<!-- Seminomas prognosis -->

**Highly radiosensitive** and have an excellent prognosis with treatment. Later stage neoplasms often require surgical resection (orchidectomy)..

## Embryonal Carcinoma

<!-- Embryonal carcinoma is, spread by -->

Rare malignant tumor comprised of **immature, primitive cells** that form **papillary/glandular structures**. Metastasis is commonly **hematogenous**.

<!-- Embryonal carcinomas histology and gross -->

On histology will appear as sheets of undifferentiated cells with marked nuclear atypia, prominent nucleoli, and focal glandular differentiation or papillary morphology.

**Gross appearance is a pale grey, bulky, hemorrhagic and necrotic tumor.**

<!-- Embryonal carcinomas prognosis -->

Are less radiosensitive than seminomas, and also more aggressive with an intermediate prognosis. **Chemotherapy may result in differentiation into another type of germ cell tumor (e.g. teratoma)**.

<!-- Embryonal carcinoma symptoms -->

The clinical presentation includes the following:

- Palpable testicular mass
- **Painful**. (Note: this is different from other testicular tumors, which are usually _painless_)

## Choriocarcinoma

<!-- Choriocarcinoma is and prognosis -->

Malignant tumor of syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts (placenta-like tissue, but villi are absent). It is the most aggressive testicular tumor; **poor prognosis**..

<!-- Choriocarcinomas Histology and gross -->

On histology reveal mixed proliferation of **syncytiotrophoblasts** (large multinucleated cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm that produce beta-hCG) and **cytotrophoblasts** (mononuclear cells with clear cytoplasm)..

The gross appearance is a small primary tumor with extensive **necrosis and hemorrhage.**

<!-- Choriocarcinoma tumor markers and labs, endocrine symptom -->

Tumor marker used to monitor and/or confirm the diagnosis is an **elevated hCG** (human chorionic gonadotropin) in nearly 100% of cases. This may present as gynecomastia, because if you recall hCG has a similar alpha subunit as LH (↑ LH → breast development)

The alpha-subunit of beta-hCG is similar to the alpha-subunit of **LH**, **FSH**, and **TSH**. This can result in **hyperthyroidism**. The beta-subunit is the unique subunit to each hormone, and is responsible for the majority of their physiologic effects.

<!-- Choriocarcinomas spread -->

Commonly **metastasize hematogenously,** most commonly to the **lungs (causing hemoptysis), brain (causing hemorrhagic stroke), and liver**.

## Testicular Teratomas

<!-- Mature teratoma in male vs female -->

In **males are malignant** (often squamous cell malignancy). This is important to remember, because the mature teratoma (dermoid cyst) in **females is benign**..

<!-- Teratoma aka -->

aka dermoid cyst.

# Non Germ cell

<!-- Male Sex Cord-Stromal Tumors are, two common types -->

Resemble sex cord-stromal tissues of the testicle, and they are usually benign. The two most common types are **Leydig cell** and **Sertoli cell** tumors..

## Leydig cell tumor

<!-- Leydig Cell, Interstitial, Tumor is, produces -->

Benign tumor of Leydig cells that **produces androgens** and may also produce estrogens..

<!-- Leydig cell tumor symptoms -->

Patient presentation will depend on age; **precocious puberty** in children and **gynecomastia** in adult men.

<!-- Leydig cell tumor histology -->

A characteristic finding on microscopy is intracytoplasmic **Reinke crystals**(rod-shaped crystals) within the neoplastic Leydig cells..

## Sertoli Cell Tumor

<!-- Sertoli Cell Tumor is and symptoms. Difference from Leydig cell -->

Benign tumor of Sertoli cells that is comprised of tubules. It most commonly does **not produce hormones** and therefore presents as a **testicular mass**..

## Testicular Lymphoma

<!-- Testicular Lymphoma epidemiology -->

Most common cause of testicular cancer found in **males >60 years old**. They are often bilateral, and arise due to metastasis.

## Diffuse large B cell Non-Hodgkin

<!-- Diffuse Large B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma epidemiology -->

The most common testicular lymphoma subtype.
