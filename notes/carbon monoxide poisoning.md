# CO Poisoning

## Cause

Carbon monoxide, a colorless and odorless gas, can be potentially fatal after exposure if not properly diagnosed and treated. Carbon monoxide poisoning is associated with:

- **Automobile exhaust**
- **Inadequately ventilated heaters** (hence most commonly occurring in the winter)
- **Methylene chloride ingestion** (converts to CO hepatically)

## Pathophysiology

Carbon monoxide has several pathophysiological consequences on oxygen transport and utilization:

- **Carbon monoxide binds to heme with 240x the affinity of oxygen forming carboxyhemoglobinemia**
- **Allosteric changes of the heme moiety prevent oxygen unloading peripherally**
- **CO binds to various proteins affecting oxidative phosphorylation**

## Symptoms

In addition to a history consistent with CO exposure, patients with mild CO poisoning present with:

- **Headache** (most common symptom)
- **Viral-like symptoms** (e.g. **dizziness**, **nausea**, **vomiting**, **malaise**)
- **Altered mental status**

Patients severely exposed to carbon monoxide typically present with:

- Neuropsych symptoms: **seizures, delirium**
- Cardiology symptoms: **myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias**
- \*\*Mortality \*\*

Physical exam signs of carbon monoxide toxicity may include:

- **Tachycardia**
- **Pallor or Cherry-red skin**
- **Memory disturbance**
- **Neuropsychiatric: emotional lability, impaired judgment**
- **Pulmonary edema**

## Diagnosis

The diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning is dependent upon:

- **History**
- **Physical exam**
- **Arterial blood gases demonstrating elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels**

Following the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning, an **electrocardiogram** is recommended to detect for ischemia as myocardial infarction is a common complication.

Carboxyhemoglobin shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left, impairing the ability of heme to unload oxygen at the tissue level.  This results in **tissue hypoxia**.  The kidney responds to tissue hypoxia by producing **more erythropoietin** (EPO).  EPO stimulates the bone marrow to differentiate more red blood cells.  Chronic CO toxicity is a cause of **secondary polycythemia**.

**Chronic tobacco smokers** may have up to 15% carboxyhemoglobin at baseline.

Carbon monoxide saturation levels **above 40% is considered to be severe exposure**, whereas levels **above 55% can potentially be fatal.**

## Management

The management of carbon monoxide poisoning includes:

- **Removal from the carbon monoxide source**
- **100% high-flow oxygen or a hyperbaric oxygen chamber** (decreases the half life of CO)
- **Intubate if necessary**
