# olecranon bursitis

- related: [[MSK]]

- pt:

- cause:
	- overproduction of bursa fluid
	- mechanical: pressure, friction, overuse
	- inflammatory: autoimmune (RA)

- sx:
	- acute elbow pain with localized swelling

- dx:
	- aspiration to differentiate septic from sterile

**Septic olecranon bursitis** is common, and can be due to direct bacterial seeding of the bursa or extension from a local cellulitis.  _Staphylococcus aureus_ is the most common causative organism.  Septic bursitis can occur as a primary syndrome or as an acute worsening of underlying chronic bursitis.  It typically causes significant pain, tenderness, and erythema, but fever and systemic leukocytosis may be absent, especially in patients with underlying immunosuppression (eg, diabetes, chronic kidney disease).

Mild septic bursitis in immunocompetent patients may be managed with oral antibiotics and close follow-up, but severe cases and patients with underlying immune compromise (as in this patient) should be admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics.
