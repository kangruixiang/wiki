# thyroidectomy and calcium

<!-- hypocalcemia and thyroidectomy management -->

- post thyroidectomy, pts can have chronic hypoparathyroidism with hypocalcemia
- at follow up 6 months, obtain 24 hour urine calcium
- without PTH, urinary calcium excretion increased, leading to nephrolithiasis and renal insufficiency
- goal serum Ca level: low-normal
- goal mag: > 2
- goal urine calcium: normal
- If urinary Ca > 300mg/25hrs, decrease Ca and/or vitamin D replacement
- thiazide diuretics can be used to decreased calcium excretion

Transient hypocalcemia is common in the first 24 hours after total thyroidectomy, occurring in about 60-90% of patients.  Monitoring postoperative serum calcium and aggressively repleting calcium, either orally or intravenously, avoids complications of hypocalcemia.

==Laryngospasm== causing inspiratory stridor after thyroidectomy is a medical emergency.  The timing of stridor after thyroidectomy can provide a clue to its cause.  If respiratory distress or stridor is apparent immediately upon extubation, ==bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury== is likely **(Choice B)**.  Stridor appearing within a few hours of surgery suggests possible wound ==hematoma with tracheal compression== **(Choice E)**.  Prompt removal of bandages and examination of the wound for swelling should be performed.  Stridor appearing later, especially if preceded by paresthesias or muscle cramps, suggests ==hypocalcemia== from transient hypoparathyroidism or inadvertent parathyroidectomy.
