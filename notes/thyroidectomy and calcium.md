- related: [[Endocrine]]

<!-- hypocalcemia and thyroidectomy management -->

- post thyroidectomy, pts can have chronic hypoparathyroidism with hypocalcemia
- at follow up 6 months, obtain 24 hour urine calcium
- without PTH, urinary calcium excretion increased, leading to nephrolithiasis and renal insufficiency
- goal serum Ca level: low-normal
- goal mag: > 2
- goal urine calcium: normal
- If urinary Ca > 300mg/25hrs, decrease Ca and/or vitamin D replacement
- thiazide diuretics can be used to decreased calcium excretion
