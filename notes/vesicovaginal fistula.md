| **Vesicovaginal fistula** |                                                              |

| **Risk factors**          | Pelvic surgery<br/>Pelvic irradiation<br/>Prolonged labor/childbirth trauma<br/>Genitourinary malignancy |
| **Clinical features**     | Painless, continuous urine leakage from the vagina           |
| **Diagnostic studies**    | Physical examination<br/>Dye test<br/>Cystourethroscopy      |

This patient's **continuous painless urine leakage** is most likely due tovesicovaginal fistula after her recent pelvic surgery.  In industrialized countries, most urogenital fistulas are due to **pelvic surgery** or **radiotherapy** for cancer.  Fistulas may result from occult bladder injury during pelvic surgery or from tissue ischemia due to excessive surgical dissection.  **Urinary incontinence** (eg, persistent uncontrolled leakage) into the vagina may present **within a month after surgery**.

The diagnosis is made clinically by visualization of urine leaking into the vagina.  Sometimes a small area of granulation tissue or a hole may be seen.  Dye tests and/or cystourethroscopy may be performed to identify a small fistula that is difficult to detect on visual inspection.  **Cystitis** may be a complication, and urinalysis may indicate infection (positive leukocyte esterase/nitrites, bacteriuria, pyuria), as seen in this patient.  Bladder catheterization in the immediate postoperative period allows a small fistula to heal.  Otherwise, surgical correction is indicated.

Methylene blue is instilled into the bladder to diagnose urinary incontinence due to a vesicovaginal fistula. The test is positive if a tampon placed in the vagina becomes blue after the dye is instilled in the bladder.
