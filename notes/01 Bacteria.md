# 01 Bacteria

## Cell Wall

<!-- Cell wall differences between gram positive and neg bacteria -->

.

- Gm +: thicker peptidoglycan cell wall, take up stain
- Gm -: outer membrane unique

## Peptidoglycan

<!-- Peptidoglycan is, made up of what molecules -->

## Cell Membrane

<!-- Cell membrane in bacteria function -->

ECT and oxidative phosphorylation in bacteria happens here. Contains enzymes and carrier molecules.

## Gm positive membrane

<!-- Gm+ cell membrane unique feature and function -->

## Gm negative membrane

<!-- Gm- cell membrane unique features and function -->

- Periplasm also contains peptidoglycan

- Pts very very sick with gram negative bacteria

## LPS

<!-- LPS is, contains -->

- on outer membrane of gm -

# Stains

<!-- Bacteria gram stain -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/WNKhESI.jpg)

.

- gram +: purple (**P**ositive for **P**urple)
- gram -: red

<!-- Gram stain process -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/Nq5jgKG.jpg)

- Iodine: all cells become purple
- Decolorization: only gram + retain color

<!-- example bacteria that don't stain well -->
