# fetal growth restriction

- related: [[OBGYN]]

<!-- fetal growth restriction pt, symmetric vs asymmetric, sx, management -->

- pt: ultrasound-estimated fetal weight <10th percentile for gestational age
- cause: increased umbilical artery resistance
	- symmetric:
		- entire fetus affected
		- first trimester
		- Chromosomal abnormalities, infection (eg, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis)
	- asymmetric:
		- head sparing (blood redistribute to brain and away from abd)
		- 2nd/3rd trimester
		- maternal comorbidities (eg, renal disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus), and multiple gestation
- sx:
	- **placental insufficiency** that impedes normal fetal growth.
	- fetal hypoxia
	- preterm delivery
- management:
	- Screening serial **umbilical artery Doppler sonography** and biophysical profiles to evaluate for worsening placental insufficiency and the development of fetal hypoxia
	- Growth measurements are performed every 3-4 weeks.
	- **Absent or reversed umbilical artery end-diastolic flow** suggests placental insufficiency and impending **fetal hypoxia**, particularly with concomitant oligohydramnios, and is an **indication for delivery**.
