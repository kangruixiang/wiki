- Level of alcohol induced liver disease: steatosis, steatohepatitis, severe steatohepatitis (alcoholic hepatitis)
- ANI index can be used to determine whether alcoholic or nonalcoholic liver disease: [](https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/transplant-medicine/calculators/the-alcoholic-liver-disease-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-index-ani/itt-20434726)<https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/transplant-medicine/calculators/the-alcoholic-liver-disease-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-index-ani/itt-20434726>

## Symptoms

- fever, jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, leukocytosis

## Diagnosis

- Labs: ==mildly elevated AST:ALT ratio > 2==, high GGT, high INR, thrombocytopenia, elevated MCV
- clinical diagnosis: evidence of porrtal HTN with hx of consistent alcohol intake
- US or CT: steatosis, cirrhosis, portal hypertension
- Severity determined by ==Maddrey score: MDF score== = 4.6 (prothrombin time â€“ control prothrombin time) + total bilirubin (mg/dL)
- Can also use MELD score > 20 = moderate/severe disease
- Score of 32 or greater or hepatic encephalopathy defined as severe cases

## Treatment

- Nonsevere, MDF < 32: supportive, no prednisolone
- thiamine, alcohol treatment
- Pentoxifylline not effective, do not use
- Severe: prednisolone (STOPAH trial showing improved 28 day mortality)
	- CI includes active infection, UGIB, AKI, HCV/HBV, multiorgan failure
- Assess response on ==day 7 with Lille score==, discontinue if no response >0.45
- Lille score less than 0.45: continue prednisolone for 28 days

## Progonosis

- Alcohol abstinence can result in significant stabilization of liver function and reversal of portal hypertension.
- Liver transplantation is reserved for appropriate candidates who are at low risk for alcohol relapse.
