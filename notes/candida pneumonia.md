Bronchial tree colonization with _Candida_ species is common in critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation, but ==primary _Candida_ pneumonia and invasive disease are rare==.  _Candida_ pneumonia is usually not due to aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions but rather to ==hematogenous spread from disseminated candidiasis== (eg, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or endocarditis).  As a result, diagnosis of _Candida_ pneumonia ==requires histopathological confirmation==.

Current guidelines do not recommend antifungal treatment or repeat cultures for immunocompetent patients with _Candida_ from respiratory sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage unless they are immunocompromised.  ==Antifungal treatment== is also reserved for immunocompetent patients with a ==primary _Candida_ infection at another== site who develop new pulmonary lesions suspicious for hematogenous spread.  ==Fluconazole== is preferred for treating candidemia, but echinocandins (eg, ==micafungin==) are recommended in patients with severe illness or recent azole exposure.
