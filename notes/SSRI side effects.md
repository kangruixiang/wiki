# SSRI side effects

This patient reports some improvement of his depression as well as new symptoms that are likely early side effects of the **selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)** fluoxetine (ie, nausea, anxiety, insomnia).  **Gastrointestinal** and **activating side effects** are common at the start of SSRI treatment, and **tolerance typically develops** over several weeks.  In contrast, SSRI-related sexual dysfunction often does not respond to watchful waiting.

Has the longest half life with active metabolites; therefore, it does not need to be tapered because of a low risk of SSRI discontinuation syndrome (a phenomenon characterized by headaches, dizziness, nausea, and malaise).

Is the most likely SSRI to cause GI disturbances.

Up to 50% of patients treated with **selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors** (SSRIs) may experience some degree of **sexual dysfunction** (eg, impaired orgasm, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction) as a side effect of treatment.  The choice of management strategy should take into account the patient's response to antidepressants.  In **SSRI responders**, such as this patient, augmentation with a second agent is preferred to switching to an alternate agent.  In men with erectile dysfunction, **augmentation** with a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (eg, **==sildenafil==**) is recommended.  For women, ==augmentation with bupropion== is typically suggested, although a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor is a reasonable option in those whose sexual dysfunction is limited to ==anorgasmia==.

For patients with **no response** or only modest benefit from their SSRI, **==switching** to a non-SSRI antidepressant== is recommended.  Options include **==bupropion** and **mirtazapine==**, as these antidepressants are associated with lower rates of adverse sexual effects compared with SSRIs. ==Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as venlafaxine== have also been associated with sexual dysfunction, making bupropion a better option.
