# SSRI side effects

- related: [[pharmacology]]

This patient reports some improvement of his depression as well as new symptoms that are likely early side effects of the **selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)** fluoxetine (ie, nausea, anxiety, insomnia).  **Gastrointestinal** and **activating side effects** are common at the start of SSRI treatment, and **tolerance typically develops** over several weeks.  In contrast, SSRI-related sexual dysfunction often does not respond to watchful waiting.

Has the longest half life with active metabolites; therefore, it does not need to be tapered because of a low risk of SSRI discontinuation syndrome (a phenomenon characterized by headaches, dizziness, nausea, and malaise).

<!-- sertraline se -->

Is the most likely SSRI to cause GI disturbances.
