Although **tamoxifen** has anti-estrogenic effects in the breast, it exerts estrogen-mimetic effects on the coagulation system and is associated with increased rates of **venous thromboembolism** (VTE).  Risk of VTE is particularly high during the first 2 years of therapy and in those who require **prolonged immobilization** due to surgery (or travel).  As a result, patients who take tamoxifen for primary prophylaxis (as in this patient with atypical ductal hyperplasia) should discontinue the medication **2-4 weeks prior** to any surgery associated with a moderate or high risk of VTE (eg, hip replacement).  Those on tamoxifen for cancer treatment should discuss perioperative cessation with their oncologist.  Procedures associated with a low risk of VTE usually do not require tamoxifen cessation.
