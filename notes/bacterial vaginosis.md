This patient has **bacterial vaginosis** (BV) based on a **thin, malodorous vaginal discharge** and **clue cells** (eg, stippled epithelial cells) on wet mount microscopy. BV occurs when the concentration of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli in the vagina decreases and the vaginal pH increases, resulting in an **overgrowth of anaerobic vaginal flora** (eg, _Gardnerella vaginalis_, _Mycoplasma hominis_). The decreased lactobacilli concentration that leads to BV can be due to hormonal fluctuation (eg, pregnancy), menses, sexual activity, antibiotic use, or douching.

BV is diagnosed when 3 of the following criteria are present:

- Homogeneous vaginal discharge
- Vaginal pH >4.5
- Amine odor after application of potassium hydroxide
- Clue cells (epithelial cells covered in bacteria) on wet mount microscopic examination

Patients with symptomatic BV are treated with oral or vaginal **metronidazole** or **clindamycin** as these antibiotics provide anaerobic coverage and improve the vaginal microflora balance; however, recurrence is common.

**Bacterial vaginosis** (BV) in pregnancy is associated with complications including spontaneous abortion, **preterm premature rupture of membranes**, **preterm labor**, chorioamnionitis, and postpartum endometritis **(Choice E)**. However, screening and treating patients (symptomatic or asymptomatic) for BV does not decrease the incidence of these complications **(Choice A)**. During pregnancy, only patients who have **symptomatic BV** are treated with **metronidazole** or **clindamycin**; the treatment goal is symptom relief rather than prevention of adverse obstetric outcomes.
