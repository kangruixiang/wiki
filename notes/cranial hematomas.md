Caput:

- path: subcutaneous, above periosteum, between skin and galea
- pt: pressure against dilating cervix in head first delivery (vertex), after prolonged labor or vacuum assisted delivery
- symptoms
	- **extend across midline**/sutures
	- poorly defined margins
	- discoloration
	- PE shows boggy region of scalp with pitting edema and ill defined borders that do not expand over time

- symptoms
	- bulging head
	- **jaundice**, hyperbilirubin from hemolysis

	- crosses midline
	- rapid expansion of swelling can be fatal due to shock and massive blood loss
