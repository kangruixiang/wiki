- syncope: short ddx
- presyncope: very long ddx
- good history is very important
	- differentiate between true syncope vs presyncope
	- does this sound like arrhythmia, tachy brady syndrome
	- cereral hypoperfusion
		- abrupt, no prodromal, no confusion
		- lights off/on
		- no tired/confused/postictal
	- PE: carotid sound
	- ECG

This patient has most likely experienced cardiogenic syncope due to ventricular tachycardia (VT); scarring from previous myocardial infarction (evidenced by Q waves on ECG) increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia.  Syncope due to VT usually has no warning symptoms (other than palpitations in some patients).  The arrhythmia spontaneously terminates within a few minutes, resulting in restoration of cardiac output and rapid patient recovery with no residual symptoms.
