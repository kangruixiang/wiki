This patient's clinical features suggest ==tarsal tunnel syndrome==, which is due to ==posterior tibial nerve compression== as it passes under the flexor retinaculum posterior to the ==medial malleolus==.  Tarsal tunnel syndrome is most common ==following an ankle fracture or dislocation== involving the talus, calcaneus, or medial malleolus, in which scar tissue, bony spurs, or bone/cartilage fragments can compress the nerve.  Other etiologies include ==malignancy or inflammatory conditions== (eg, rheumatoid arthritis).

Patients usually develop pain and paresthesias in the distribution of the nerve ==(sole of the foot, distal foot, or toes)==.  The pain can radiate up to the heel and calf and is ==worse at night or with standing==.  Taking off shoes often relieves the discomfort.  Examination can show a positive **==Tinel's sign==** (tingling sensation on light percussion over the nerve) and/or sensory loss.  Severe nerve injury can lead to ==atrophy of intrinsic foot muscles==.  Diagnosis is mainly clinical, although electrodiagnostic testing may be helpful.  Treatment includes anti-inflammatory medications (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), shoe modification, or corticosteroid injection, with decompressive surgery in refractory cases.
