This patient has multiple findings to suggest **subacute infective endocarditis** (ie, fatigue, low-grade fevers, splenic infarcts, murmur of aortic regurgitation).  No growth on 3 sets of blood cultures after ≥7 days is consistent with **==culture-negative endocarditis==** (CNE), which suggests ==fungi== or ==fastidious bacteria== (eg, _Coxiella burnetii_, _Bartonella_ spp, _Tropheryma whippelii_) as the most likely organism.  HACEK bacteria are relatively easily detected by modern culture methods and are no longer considered a common cause of CNE.

In a large epidemiologic study of CNE, _**==C burnetii==**_ was the most common organism identified; it is typically contracted by droplet exposure from ==infected livestock==.  Acute infection manifests as **Q fever**, which typically consists of pneumonia with flu-like symptoms and hepatitis but can be asymptomatic.  Infective endocarditis can occur several months following acute infection; it is seen primarily in men age >40, pregnant women, and patients with underlying valvular pathology.

The modified Duke criteria are used for diagnosis; positive Q fever serology (IgG antibody titer >1:800) is considered a major clinical criterion.  Initial diagnostic evaluation should include ==transthoracic or transesophageal **echocardiography==** to identify valvular vegetations and perivalvular lesions.  Positron emission tomography may also be helpful in suggesting infectious valvular pathology.
