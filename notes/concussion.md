**Concussion** is a mild traumatic brain injury caused by axonal shearing from rapid rotational acceleration of the brain during a fall or strike to the head.  Children and adolescents playing contact sports (eg, soccer) are at increased risk for concussions.

Patients are usually diagnosed clinically based on the presence of a **neurologic disturbance** (eg, headache, cognitive dysfunction) after head trauma.  Neuroimaging is not typically required unless high-risk features for structural intracranial injury are present (ie, altered mental status, loss of consciousness, severe headache/vomiting, severe mechanism of injury, signs of basilar skull fracture).

Initial management is **physical and cognitive rest** for 24-48 hours.  Athletes should then follow a **gradual return-to-play protocol** with progressive intensity of physical exercise (eg, light aerobics → moderate noncontact activity → competitive play) as tolerated.  If **symptoms worsen** at any level of exertion, a **24-hour rest** period is recommended before returning to the **previous step** in the protocol that did not exacerbate symptoms.

In this case, the patient tolerated light aerobics but developed dizziness and nausea with moderate exercise; therefore, she should rest for a day and then **return to light aerobic activity**.

Brain imaging to exclude structural intracranial injury may be considered for worsening symptoms despite appropriate rest and adherence to the gradual return-to-play protocol.  In contrast, this patient's symptoms that wax and wane with exertion are typical of a concussion and can be managed by adjusting the activity level.
