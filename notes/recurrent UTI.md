## Recurrent UTI in young women

<!-- Recurrent UTI in young women management -->

Recurrent UTIs are a common problem in otherwise healthy young adult females, however there is no evidence that they lead to other health problems such as hypertension in the absence of underlying anatomic abnormalities.

Behavioral interventions such as **postcoital voiding** and **increased intake of cranberry juice** may help to decrease the risk of UTIs in some women.  **Antibiotic prophylaxis** can be considered in women who have had more than two UTIs in six months or more than three UTIs in a year.  Prophylaxis can be used either continuously for up to several years or solely after intercourse in women whose UTIs occur only after sexual activity.  Fluoroquinolones, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and nitrofurantoin are the most commonly used agents.  An additional option is providing female patients with antibiotics in advance, and allowing the patient to self-diagnose and treat her UTIs.
