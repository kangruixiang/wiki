<!-- esophageal perforation diagnosis and management -->

This patient's presentation suggests spontaneous esophageal rupture (SER).  SER ==(Boerhaave syndrome)== is usually due to prolonged nausea and vomiting causing an acute rise of intraesophageal pressure combined with negative intrathoracic pressure.  This leads to a transmural esophageal tear and acute barotrauma with esophageal air/fluid leaking into surrounding areas (eg, mediastinum, pleura).  Although it is a rare diagnosis, SER has a 20% mortality rate, usually due to infectious complications (eg, empyema, mediastinitis, septic shock).

Patients usually present with vomiting/retching and chest/upper abdominal pain with ==rapid progression to odynophagia, fever, dyspnea, and septic shock==.  Physical examination may show ==subcutaneous emphysema== but is not a sensitive finding.  Chest x-ray may reveal ==pneumomediastinum or pleural effusions==.  Pleural fluid analysis is typically exudative with low pH and **==very high amylase==** (> 2500 IU).  ==Computed tomography or contrast esophagography== with Gastrografin is preferred for confirming the diagnosis.

==Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with insufflation of air can extend the perforation and introduce air into the mediastinum==.  However, when done under a controlled setting in the operating room, EGD may be useful for select patients to directly visualize the perforation and plan treatment.
