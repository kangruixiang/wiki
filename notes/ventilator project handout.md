## Phases of breathing

- initiation
- inspiratory
- plateau
- expiratory

## Types of pressure

- Pressure

- Driving pressure

- Compliance

- Resistance

## Terminologies

- Breaths can be assisted or controlled
	- controlled: triggered by ventilator
	- assisted: interactive with patient effort

- Trigger: what tells ventilator to start a breath
	- ventilator triggered. E.g. time
	- patient triggered. E.g. negative pressure, flow, diaphragm activity

- Limit variable: highest limit variable can get
	- pressure in pressure control
	- volume in volume control

- Control variable: independent parameter targeted by ventilator
	- e.g. pressure in pressure modes
	- e.g. flow in volume modes

- In pressure mode, ventilator limits pressure by controlling amount of pressure given

- in volume mode, ventilator limits volume by controlling amount of flow

- Cycle variable: what causes ventilator to cycle from inspiration to expiration

- PEEP: what ventilator does between breaths

## Modes

## Management of mechanical ventilation

Initiation

- confirm placement with ETT and end tidal CO2 to ensure tracheal placement
- followed by chest Xray to confirm appropriate depth 5+-2 cm from carina
- no need for daily CXR
- follow up ABG 30-60 min

## Liberating

- when to liberate
- SAT with SBT trial
- extubate check list
- post extubation
