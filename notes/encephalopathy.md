## Wernecke Korsakoff

<!-- Wernicke sx, treatment. Korsakoff sx -->

**Wernicke encephalopathy** (WE) is a life-threatening disorder of **thiamine deficiency** seen most commonly in patients with **heavy alcohol use** and/or severe malnutrition. The classic features of WE include:

- **Encephalopathy** - disorientation and confusion
- **Oculomotor dysfunction** - lateral rectus palsy
- **Gait ataxia** - wide-based gait or complete gait impairment

No specific testing for thiamine deficiency is available, but laboratory evidence of alcoholic hepatitis (2:1 ratio of aspartate to alanine  aminotransferase) or synthetic hepatic dysfunction (prolonged INR, low  albumin) often supports the diagnosis.

Treatment with **intravenous thiamine**, a well-tolerated and low-risk medication, is required with urgency.  Because all 3 clinical features of WE are present in <10% of affected patients, treatment is generally given to those in whom the diagnosis  is possible (eg, unclear cause of gait ataxia or confusion).  Intravenous thiamine usually improves ocular abnormalities within hours, but confusion and gait ataxia may persist for days or weeks; many  patients never fully recover.

**Korsakoff syndrome** (KS) is a  late-stage complication of chronic thiamine deficiency due to repeated  or prolonged episodes of Wernicke encephalopathy (WE). Up to 80% of  patients recovering from an acute episode of WE show signs of KS,  including significant **retrograde** and **anterograde amnesia**, often with **confabulation**. Cognition, attention, social behavior, and long-term memory are relatively preserved.

Patients with KS typically have **mammillary body atrophy** on MRI of the brain. Unlike WE, the neurocognitive changes of KS  rarely improve; most patients require long-term supervision and social  support.

## MELAS

<!-- mitochondrial enceophalopathy is, sx, inheritance -->

**Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)**, one of the most common mitochondrial myopathies, typically affects patients age <40 and presents with **stroke-like episodes** (eg, hemiparesis, vision abnormalities), **seizures**, muscle weakness, **hearing loss**, and **lactic acidosis** (due to mitochondrial dysfunction). Brain lesions, which are the  result of defective mitochondrial energy production, are termed  "stroke-like" as they do not correspond to vascular territories.

Many mitochondrial myopathies are **maternally inherited**, with the condition being passed from the affected mother to **male and female offspring** (although heteroplasmy can result in variable clinical expression); however, **male** offspring do **not** further transmit the condition. This corresponds to the depicted  pedigree: The grandmother of the patient had MELAS and transmitted it  to all her children, but only her daughters (ie, the patient's aunt and  mother) transmitted the disease to their offspring.
