## Nitrates

<!-- nitrates MOA.. -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/jHfVolP.jpg)

- Dynamite: nitrates (e.g. nitroglycerine)
- Nitric oxide exhaust: nitrates are metabolized and release nitric oxide
- Grump: nitric oxide causes an increase in cGMP in vascular smooth muscle cells
- Chains constricting pants/shirts: MLCK usually causes vasoconstriction
- Cut P lock off chain: increased cGMP causes myosin light chain dephosphorylation, preventing its interaction with actin.
- Dilated blue pants: nitrates cause venous dilation and increased venous capacitance
- Modestly dilated red sleeves: nitrates cause some vasodilation of large arteries, but minimal dilation of arterioles
- preload: Nitrates decrease preload

<!-- nitrates given how, treat.. -->

- Folded tongue: sublingual administration of nitroglycerine avoids first pass metabolism (for acute symptom relief)
- Anvil: antianginal therapy
- Angina anvil:nitrates treat chronic stable angina
- Discarded oxygen mask: nitrates reduce myocardial oxygen requirements
- Anvil medal: nitrates treat Prinzmetal angina
