## EHEC vs Shigella

<!-- EHEC vs Shigella, rx --> 

EHEC infection occurs after **exposure** to infected **animals** (eg, farms, petting zoos) or ingestion of undercooked beef. _Shigella_ _sonnei_ causes bloody diarrhea and abdominal  cramps. However, affected patients are commonly febrile, and animal  exposure is not typical as it is usually contracted through contaminated food or water.

**Antimicrobials** should be **avoided** as they may increase the risk of developing **hemolytic uremic syndrome** (HUS), a dangerous complication of EHEC infection.
