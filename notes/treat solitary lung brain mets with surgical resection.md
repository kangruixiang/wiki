Nearly 40% of patients with systemic cancer develop **brain metastases**, usually through hematogenous spread.  Imaging features suggesting metastatic disease include circumscribed margins, location at the gray-white matter junction, patterns of vasogenic edema, and multiple lesions.  The most common underlying primary tumors are lung, renal cell, breast, colorectal, and melanoma.

This patient likely has **primary lung cancer**, which may be small cell (SCLC) or non-small cell (NSCLC).  Brain metastases from SCLC appear to respond initially to chemotherapy, but studies have shown variable overall response rates without significant survival benefit.  Adding whole-brain radiation (WBRT) improves the response rate to chemotherapy but without significant survival benefit.  NSCLC is not as chemosensitive as SCLC, and brain metastases respond better to WBRT and/or surgical resection.  As a result, **surgical resection** is usually considered for brain metastases due to SCLC or NSCLC.

Options for treating **solitary** lung-brain metastases include **surgical resection followed by WBRT** or **stereotactic radiosurgery with or without WBRT**.  Surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery followed by WBRT reduces the risk of tumor recurrence and the likelihood of neurologic death **(Choice E)**.  Surgical success depends on resectability, feasibility of decreasing mass effect, proximity to vital areas, age, and performance status.  Patients with a resected solitary lung-brain metastasis have a median survival of 40 weeks.  This patient with likely primary lung cancer should undergo resection without the need for brain biopsy.
