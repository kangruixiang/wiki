# acute pericarditis

<!--  acute pericarditis rx -->

- Naproxen in combination with colchicine is the treatment of choice for most patients with idiopathic or viral acute pericarditis.
- Avoid nsaids other than aspirin and glucocorticoids for peri-infarction pericarditis due to decreased healing and increased rupture risk
- 1st line: high-dose aspirin (eg, 650 mg 3 times a day) for symptomatic relief.
	- High-dose aspirin is believed to provide analgesia and anti-inflammatory effect while having a relatively small effect on myocardial healing and scar formation compared to other anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS, glucocorticoids).
