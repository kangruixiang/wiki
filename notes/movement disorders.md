<!-- acute dystonic reaction from antipsychotics treatment -->

This patient is experiencing an **acute dystonic reaction** manifested by **torticollis** and an **oculogyric crisis** (forced, sustained elevation of the eyes in an upward position). Acute dystonia is a type of **extrapyramidal symptom** (EPS) that develops within hours to days of starting or dose escalation of **antipsychotics**.  This patient's risk factors include young age, male sex, and use of a  high-potency, first-generation antipsychotic (haloperidol). Other types of EPS include akathisia (inner restlessness) and drug-induced  parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, masked facies).

## PD

<!-- Parkinson disease sx, parkinson plus sx -->

**Parkinson disease** (PD) is a clinical diagnosis that requires the presence of **bradykinesia** in addition to either **tremor** or **rigidity**.  The majority of patients will have all of these physical findings at  some point in their disease course. A clear response to dopaminergic  therapy (eg, levodopa/carbidopa, pramipexole) is also highly supportive  of the diagnosis. Other features suggestive of the disease include a **unilateral onset** and **persistent asymmetry** of symptoms. Asymmetric hand rigidity would be the finding most consistent with the diagnosis of PD in this patient.

**Parkinson-plus syndromes** (eg, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy) can also  present with bradykinesia and rigidity; however, distinguishing features include rapid progression, symmetric motor signs, lack of tremor, falls early in the course of the disease, dysautonomia, and a poor response  to dopaminergic therapy.

Gaze palsy is more consistent with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a Parkinsonian-plus syndrome characterized by problems with vertical  gaze and falls due to postural instability. Resting tremor is rare in  PSP.
