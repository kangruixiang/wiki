**Primary ovarian insufficiency** (POI) is ovarian failure in women **age <40**.  Patients typically present with irregular or **absent menses**, often after cessation of oral contraceptives, which can mask menstrual irregularities.  In younger women, symptoms (eg, hot flashes, **flushing**, night sweats) are often attributed to mood disorders (eg, anxiety) or relationship issues (eg, **dyspareunia**).  Patients with POI have an **elevated FSH** level within the postmenopausal range (consistent with ovarian failure).  Most cases are idiopathic.  Otherwise, common etiologies of POI include: cancer treatment (eg, radiation, chemotherapy); genetic predisposition (eg, Turner syndrome, fragile X syndrome); and **autoimmune disorders** (eg, autoimmune oophoritis), as is likely in this patient with a history of hypothyroidism and family history of autoimmune conditions..

Evaluation for patients with POI should include screening for underlying etiology.  ==Bone mineral density screening== is performed due to elevated risk of osteoporosis secondary to **low estrogen** levels.  Estrogen/progestin-containing therapy can maintain or restore bone strength and control vasomotor symptoms.  Infertility due to loss of ovarian function in POI can be treated with donor egg in-vitro fertilization or donor embryo transfer.
