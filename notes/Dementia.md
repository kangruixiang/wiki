# Dementia

- related: [[Geriatrics]]

## Reversible Causes

- TSH/T4
- CMP: BUN/Cr
- LFT: liver cirrhosis
- B12
- RPR
- Screen for depression/pseudodementia
- CT/MRI: look for hydrocephalus, hematoma

## Dementia, delirium, amnesia, MCI

- Dementia: cognitive impairment (attention, concentration, speech), memory loss; chronic, insiduous, permanent
- Delirium: cognitive impairment, memory loss; acute, overt, wax/wane, reversible
- Amnesia: no cognitive impairment, memory loss

| Normal aging                        | mild cognitive impairment | Dementia   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| cognitive test -                    | test +                    | test +     |
| function normal (act independently) | function normal           | function - |

### MCI:

- mild cognitive impairment without functional impairment
- MOCA: <26 or < 25 for less educated
- 1/2 develop dementia in 5 years

## Dementia

- population
	- 1/3 people at 90 years old
	- 1/10 people at 80 year old
	- 1/20 people at 70 year old
- Normal aging: slowing over time, short term memory should be ok
- Dementia = cognitive impairment (moca) and functional impairment (IADL/ADL)
- Diagnoses based on functional status and not based on MOCA alone
- IADL: driving, meds, finances
- ADL: bathing, dressing, eating
- Takes 10 years on average to go from early to late dementia
- Typical Dementia Sx
	- delusion, hallucinations
	- aggressions
	- paranoid
	- memory loss
- Early dementia:
	- only IADL impaired
	- tangential, paucity of thoughts
	- short term memory loss, execution problems
	- MOCA < 20 or 15
- Moderate dementia:
	- some ADL impairment
	- speak 1-2 sentences
- Late dementia:
	- all ADL impairment
	- problems with ambulation, eating, falling
	- 2-3 words
- Death: from pneumonia, fall, hip fx

## Dementia Medications

### Sinemet

- carbidopa-levodopa: carbidopa for CNS. Levodopa for peripheral.
- basically dopamine
- take on empty stomach only
- half life 4 hours
- need it during the day
	- wake up => 10-50
	- lunch => 10-50
	- dinner => 10-50
- no sinemet at night
- Dosing
	- start 10-25 or 10-50
	- then 25-100
	- then 50-100 at lunch or 50-200 at lunch
	- no BID dosing

### Symptomatic

- SSRI, first line for all of the dementia sx:
	- sertraline 25mg week 1, go up to 50 then reassess in 2-3 weeks, go up to 100 or 150
	- Celexa (least drug drug): 10-40mg, minimum drug drug interaction, no CYP
	- Lexapro (least cardiac): 5-20mg, no QTC prolongation
- Remeron
- Antipsychotic: seroquel 25 (really need to 200mg for effect), risperidol 0.5, zyprexa 20. Not using these for psychosis. Take off very slowly, 25% every 2-3 weeks. Always try to go down on antipsychotics
- Mood stabilizers: depakote 25mg QHS, BID, 125 mg - 250 mg for sundowning

### Early dementia

- use ACH I: Donepezil QD, Rivastigmine BID (patch), galantamine
- 2-3 pts better on testing
- delay decline slightly
- does not stop progression
- works better in 1/3 ppl, 1/3 same, 1/3 bad SE
- SE: GI, diarrhea, dizziness, **bradycardia**

### Moderate dementia

- mostly treat sun downing, apathy, agitation, outbursts, aggression, appetite changes, sleep, acting out dreams (Lewy body),
	- hallucinations (LBD), puppies, children
	- LBD: less tremors, more bradykinesia/rigidity
	- Alzheimers: delusion
	- Vascular: disinhibition
- also has apathy, agitation, outbursts, aggression
- Memantine, behavior manage
- some respond
- SE: agitation

## Types of Dementia

### Alzheimers

- path: plaques and tangles, Ch21 association
- pt: elderly
- symptoms:
	- short term memory goes first, then long term
	- spares social graces
- diagnosis: clinical. CT shows diffused cortical atrophy
- treatment: supportive, education, Ach I

### Pick

- path: frontotemporal degeneration
- Symptoms: personality goes first (hypersexual, hyperaggressive), retain memory at first
- diagnosis: clinical. Imaging shows frontal temporal degen
- treatment: supportive

### Lewy body

- path: lewy body
- symptoms: parkinsonian symptoms with dementia. Dementia predominant. Visual hallucination.
- diagnosis: clinical. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder distinguishes from Alzheimer
- treatment: supportive

### Vascular

- path: stroke
- symptoms: step wise decline with each stroke
- diagnosis: presence of infart on imaging not enough, must have step wise decline
- treatment: treat stroke

### CJD

- path: prions
- pt: consume undercooked meat or sporadic mutation
- symptoms: really yound dementia (30-40s) with myoclonus
- diagnosis: MRI
- treatment: supportive

### NPH

- path: increased ICP
- symptoms: wet, wobbly, weird
- diagnosis: CT shows hydrocephalus. LP shows improvement of function
- treatment: VP shunt

## DM and dementia

- mod dementia: A1C < 8, goal avoid HHS
- CHF: < 7.5

## HTN

- BP 140-150/80-90 goal
- late dementia goal 160/100, avoid hypertensive crisis
