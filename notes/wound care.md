## Ulcers

- Stage 1 (no skin tear) and 2 (skin tear):
	- Mepilex and zinc
	- Use xeroform or wet to dry if dry skin
- Stage 3: can see fat or muscle
	- yellow/black tissue = dead tissue
		- use Dakins BID: bleach that breaks down dead tissues
	- red tissues = alive tissues
		- if dry: use wet to dry or xeroform
		- if wet/oozing/secretions: use aquacel AG or mepilex AG to soak up moisture. Can leave on 3 days at a time
- Stage 4: muscle, bone, tendons
	- same as above mostly
	- if eschars: can use knife or Santyl cream for enzymatic debridement
- Deep tissue injury: skin intact but dead tissues underneath
