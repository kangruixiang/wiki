## Hot flash

<!-- hot flash 1st and 2nd treatment -->

- first line: estrogen based hormone replacement therapy
	- add progestone for people with intact uterus
	- CI include **history of thromboembolism**, coronary heart disease, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer.
- nonhormonal treatment: **selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor** (eg, fluoxetine) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (eg, venlafaxine).
- 2nd line: clonidine is a second-line option for women who cannot take estrogen and do not have adequate relief from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.  However, it provides only a modest benefit and is associated with significant side effects (eg, dry mouth, constipation, dizziness).

<!-- menopausal hormone therapy risks, population -->

Combination estrogen/progesterone **menopausal hormone therapy** (MHT), or estrogen alone for women who have had a hysterectomy, is the most effective treatment available for menopausal **hot flashes**. Combination MHT is associated with an increased risk of stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), breast cancer, and venous thromboembolism. However, much of this risk is age-related; women age 50-59 have a lower risk of adverse effects, resulting in a more favorable risk-benefit profile compared with women age >60. In light of this, MHT can be safely used for a **short period** (3-5 years) in **younger, low-risk women**.

Major contraindications to MHT (even in younger women) include established CHD, active liver disease, and a history of breast cancer, venous thromboembolism, or stroke. The risk can be further stratified using a standardized cardiovascular risk calculator (eg, American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology calculator); MHT should be avoided in patients whose estimated 10-year risk of coronary events is >10%.

## SERMs

<!-- selective estrogen modulators, mechanism, indication, se -->

**Tamoxifen** is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that is used as an adjuvant therapy in patients with nonmetastatic, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and for breast cancer prevention in high-risk women (eg, atypical hyperplasia, age >35 with history of lobular carcinoma in situ).

Tamoxifen acts as an estrogen receptor agonist in the endometrium and is associated with an increased risk of **endometrial hyperplasia/cancer** and **uterine sarcoma** in postmenopausal women. In premenopausal women, tamoxifen is associated with endometrial polyp development, a typically benign cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. In asymptomatic women taking tamoxifen (such as this patient), **regular screening has no proven benefit** in detecting endometrial cancer or uterine sarcoma. Therefore, patients on tamoxifen require **evaluation only if symptoms develop** (eg, abnormal uterine bleeding, postmenopausal bleeding).
