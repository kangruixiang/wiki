Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined as a ==sustained intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) >20 mm Hg== associated with at least one organ dysfunction. Abdominal compartment syndrome occurs in the setting of abdominal surgery, trauma, hemoperitoneum, retroperitoneal bleed, ascites, bowel obstruction, ileus, and pancreatitis. It can also occur from capillary leak from massive fluid resuscitation or sepsis. Increasing IAP causes hypoperfusion and ischemia of the intestines and other peritoneal and retroperitoneal structures, leading to hemodynamic, respiratory, neurologic, and kidney impairment. Renal vein compression and renal artery vasoconstriction cause oliguric AKI.

Abdominal compartment syndrome is diagnosed by measuring IAP; ==measurement of bladder pressure with an indwelling catheter is the standard methodology==. Management includes supportive therapy, abdominal compartment decompression, and correction of positive fluid balance.
