# Male Pathology

## Hypospadius and Epispadius

<!-- Hypospadias is, association -->

Condition caused by **failure of the urethral folds to fuse completely**, which leads to an external urethral orifice open on the **ventral surface** of the penis.

- Associated with **chordee** (poorly developed penis that curves ventrally)
- More common than epispadias
- Surgically corrected to prevent UTIs

<!-- Epispadias is, association -->

Epispadias: condition caused by faulty positioning of the **genital tubercle** during development, which leads to an external urethral orifice open on the **dorsal surface** of penis.

- Associated with **exstrophy of the bladder**.

Mnemonic: **E**pi, pee in your **E**ye, associated with **E**xstrophy

## Condyloma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma

### Condyloma

<!-- Condyloma Acuminatum of penis causes, risks, locations -->

Condyloma: Due to HPV 6 and 11

### SCC

<!-- Squamous cell carcinoma of penis cause, risks, locations -->

Malignant proliferation of the squamous cells of penile skin. The current risk factors include: 

- **HPV 16, 18 serotypes** (2/3 of cases)

- **Lack of circumcision:** foreskin acts as a nidus for inflammation and irritation if not properly cleaned and maintained. 

- Uncommon in USA

- Very rare in circumcised individuals

- **Presents most commonly on the glans penis or mucosal prepuce**..

<!-- SCC spread -->

Slow growth and **local metastases to regional lymph node**.

<!-- SCC precursor lesions and their locations -->

Precursor in situ lesions:

- Bowen disease: penile shaft, scrotum. Presents as leukoplakia
- Erythroplasia of Queyrat: glans. Presents as erythroplakia
- Bowenoid papulosis: Presents as multiple reddish papules; seen in younger patients compared to other two (40s); doesn't progress to invasive carcinoma..

## Bowen's Disease

<!-- Bowen's Disease of the penis, demographics, symptoms, association -->

Precursor CIS (carcinoma in situ) that has the potential to invade.

- **Presents as a single plaque (leukoplakia) on shaft of the penis or scrotum**.
- Affects men greater than the age of 40
- Associated with visceral malignancies.

## Erythroplasia of Queyrat

<!-- Erythroplasia of Queyrat of the penis, demographics, symptoms, association -->

Precursor CIS (carcinoma in situ) that has the potential to invade.

- **Presents as a single erythematous plaque involving the mucosal surface of the glans penis or prepuce**
- Affects men greater than the age of 40. Erythroplakia.
- NO association with visceral malignancies (in contrast to Bowen's Disease).

## Bowenoid Papulosis

<!-- Bowenoid Papulosis of the penis demographics, symptoms, association -->

Precursor CIS (carcinoma in situ) that _does not_ have the potential to invade, and thus does not progress to squamous cell carcinoma.

- **Presents as multiple pigmented, red-brown verrucoid (wart-like) lesions resembling condyloma acuminatum on external genitalia**
- Affects younger men.

# Other disorders of the Penis

## Peryonie's Disease

<!-- Peyronie's disease is -->

**Subcutaneous fibrosis of the penis** that leads to curvature in any (lateral) direction. ("Painful erection in wrong direction").

## Phimosis

<!-- Phimosis is, cause, and treatment -->

Condition that most commonly occurs in uncircumcised men where the **orifice of the prepuce is too small to retract over head of penis**, leading to an increased risk of infection. Could be congenital or acquired (poor hygiene leads to chronic inflammation and scarring).

- Treatment: circumcision

## Balanitis/Balanoposthitis

<!-- Balanitis/Balanoposthitis is, cause -->

Condition that involves **inflammation of the prepuce and glans penis**.

- common in uncircumcised men with poor hygiene
- causative aent: C. albicans, anaerobic bacteria

## Priapism

<!-- Priapism is and causes -->

**Persistent abnormal erection of the penis that is not associated with sexual arousal**. Common etiologies include:

- **Sickle cell anemia** (viscous blood)
- **Trauma** (venous blood not oxygenated = engorgement)
- \*\*Drugs \*\*(e.g. **trazodone: "trazo-BONE")** (antidepressants and antipsychotics)
- **Spinal cord injury**
  Urologic emergency: can infarct penis.

# Diseases of Scrotum

## Fournier's Gangrene

<!-- Fournier's Gangrene, cause, symptoms -->

Bacterial infection caused by Staph/Strep, resulting in necrotizing fasciitis of scrotum.
