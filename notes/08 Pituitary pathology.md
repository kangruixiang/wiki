### Bitemporal hemianopsia

<!-- Bitemporal hemianopsia pathogenesis -->

Pathogenesis:

- Pituitary is next to optic chiasm. Enlargement of pituitary can cause vision problems.

<!-- anterior pituitary adenomas include -->

Include:

- Prolactinoma: common
- GH adenoma
- ACTH adenoma: Cushings
- TSH, LH, FSH: rare.

### Prolactinoma

<!-- Prolactinoma is, symptoms -->

- Benign tumor of lactotroph. Inhibits GnRH, thus LH/FSH
- Male: no breast lobular unit for milk

<!-- Prolactinoma drug cause -->

Dopamine antagonists such as the antipsychotic **risperidone** and **haloperidol**. Antiemetics, **metoclopramide**. All of these block D2 receptors..

<!-- Prolactinoma treatment -->

Treatment

- Dopamine agonists: **bromocriptine or cabergoline** to shrink tumor
- Surgery.

<!-- bromocriptine, carbergoline are -->

Dopamine agonists drugs.

### GH Excess

<!-- GH excess causes -->

Causes are usually due to tumor. Presentation can be different depending on where the tumor is. If the tumor secretes GHRH and is in the **hypothalamus** or **the sytem**, there would be a high GHRH level. If the tumor is in the **anterior pituitary**, there would be a **low GHRH and high somatostatin** level.

<!-- GH Excess Treatment -->

Treatment

- **pegvisomant**: a GH receptor antagonist that effectively blocks IGF-1 production

### Acromegaly

<!-- Acromegaly symptoms -->

- Insidious onset, 12 yrs average: difficult to diagnose
- Enlarged features
	- jaw, corse faces (enlarged nose, frontal bones)
	- tongue
	- hands and feet (rings no longer fit)
	- larynx (voice deepens)
- Enlarged visceral organs
	- **Cardiac failure**
- Enlarged joints: joint pain
- **Secondary diabetes** from GH induced liver gluconeogenesis
- Increased risk of **colon cancer**

# Hypopituitarism

<!-- Hypopituitarism is -->

Describes the **insufficient secretion of pituitary hormones resulting from diseases of the hypothalamus or the pituitary**. .

<!-- Hypopituitarism causes -->

The majority of cases are secondary to destructive processes directly involving the anterior pituitary.  This includes:

- Tumors, such as **nonfunctional pituitary adenomas** (adnomas not producing hormones) or **craniopharyngiomas**(exert pressure on adjacent pituitary cells)
- **Pituitary surgery or radiation**
- **Traumatic brain injury** and **subarachnoid hemorrhage**
- **Pituitary apoplexy** (sudden hemorrhage into the pituitary gland)
- **Sheehan syndrome** (postpartum necrosis of the anterior pituitary secondary to infarction precipitated by obstetric hemorrhage or shock)
- **Empty sella syndrome** (presence of an enlarged, empty sella turcica due to a condition that partially or totally destroys the pituitary gland; classically affects obese women with a history of multiple pregnancies).

<!-- Hypopituitarism symptoms -->

The clinical manifestation of hypopituitarism depends on the _specific hormone(s) that are lacking_.  For example, a deficiency of melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) may manifest as **hypopigmentation, due to MSH's stimulatory effects on melanocytes**. 

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/5Y6Bgge.jpg)

Aldosterone part of RAAS system, not adrenal system...

<!-- Hypopituitarism treatment -->

The treatment for hypopituitarism includes hormone replacement therapy, including:

- **Corticosteroid**
- **T4 (thyroxine)**
- **Sex steroids**
- **Human growth hormone**
- **Pulsatile GnRH** (for patients that desire fertility)..

## Empty Sella Syndrome

<!-- Empty Sella Pathogenesis -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/xeZZoD3.jpg)

- Arachnid and dura matter around sella. Pia matter around pituitary
- Herniation of arachnoid and CSF into sella compresses and destroys pituitary: hypopituitarism
- Sella filled with CSF, which is clear on imaging..

## Pituitary Apoplexy

.

## Sheehan's Syndrome

<!-- Sheehan's syndrome pathogenesis -->

Pituitary gland enlarged in preglancy as result of increased prolactin. However, the blood supply is not increased. In postpartum hemorrhage, pituitary is at risk of infarct from hypotension. ..

<!-- Sheehan's syndrome symptoms -->

Can present as shock after delivery from low cortisol levels if severe. If not severe, present as failure to lactate from loss of prolactin

Other symptoms:

- Absent menstruation from low FSH/LH
- **Loss of pubic and axillary hair** from low FSH/LH
- Cold intolerance from low TSH
- Fatigue from low GH
- Anorexia

# Posterior Pituitary Pathology

## DI

<!-- Diabetes insipidus 2 types -->

Is due to:

- Central DI:  a **lack of antidiuretic hormone** (ADH)
- Nephrogenic DI:  a \*\*lack of ADH functionality \*\*in the collecting tubules..

<!-- Diabetes Insipidus -->

Is characterized by:

- **Dilute urine** (even after water restriction)
- **Intense thirst**
- **Polyuria**.

<!-- DI labs -->

Labs:

- hypernatremia
- **Urine specific gravity < 1.006**
- **Serum osmolarity > 290 mOsm/L**..

<!-- DI diagnosis -->

A water restriction test is used to diagnose central and nephrogenc DI:

1. Water intake is restricted for 2-3 hours, and urine volume, urine osmolality, plasma Na+ concentration, and plasma osmolality are measured hourly.
2. In healthy individuals, water deprivation leads to a urine osmolality 2-4 times greater than plasma osmolality.
3. In patients with central or nephrogenic DI, **urine osmolality will be less than 300 mOsm/kg after water deprivation**..

<!-- Differentiate between central and nephrogenic DI -->

- Central: low ADH
- Nephrogenic: high ADH

DDAVP (desmopressin, an ADH analog) is administered to differentiate between central and nephrogenic DI:

- In central DI, DDAVP administration will result in a 50% or greater increase in urine osmolality.  
- **In nephrogenic DI, DDAVP administration will lead to no change in urine osmolality**..

## Central Diabetes Insipidus

<!-- Central Diabetes Insipidus cause -->

- radiation, surgery, trauma

.

<!-- Central DI treatment -->

Treatment: Desmopressin.

## Nephrogenic Diabetes

<!-- Nephrogenic DI causes -->

Is due to the inability of the kidney to respond to ADH.  This may be due to an **inherited mutation in the V2 receptor** or secondary to:

- **Lithium** (drug-induced nephrogenic DI)
- **Demeclocycline** (reduces responsiveness of kidney tubules to ADH) (treats SIADH)
- **Hypercalcemia** (causes natriuresis and water loss)
- **Hypokalemia** (decreases responsiveness of kidney tubules to ADH)
- **Sickle cell disease** (impairs renal response to ADH)..

<!-- Nephrogenic DI treatment -->

Treatment involves:

- **Adequate hydration**
- **Hydrochlorothiazide** (see below)
- **Indomethacin**
- **Amiloride**.

_Why treat a water-wasting disease with a thiazide diuretic?_ Thiazides increase renal Na+ excretion, which leads to extracellular fluid volume contraction.  This decreased volume will decrease GFR, and increase proximal tubular reabsorption of water and Na+.  Therefore, ultimately less water and Na+ are lost as urine.

## SIADH

<!-- Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH cause -->

Occurs when too much ADH is secreted by the posterior pituitary.  Common CNS causes of SIADH include:

- Brain infections (encephalitis)
- Tumors of the pituitary, or tumors that impinge on the pituitary
- Head trauma
- Psychiatric illness

Non-CNS causes of SIADH include:

- Medications (chlorpropamide, carbamazepine, cyclophosphamide and SSRIs)
- Ectopic production by lung tumors (**especially small cell carcinoma**)
- Pulmonary infection (viral, bacterial or tuberculous pneumonia)..

<!-- SIADH symptoms -->

Patients will generally present with euvolemic hyponatremia.  Total body water is increased, but near-normal blood volume is maintained due to the body's compensatory response (decreased thirst, suppressed aldosterone release).  Peripheral edema does not develop.

<!-- SIADH treatment -->

If asymptomatic, the treatment of SIADH is free water restriction.

Treatment of SIADH includes:

- Demeclocycline, an antibiotic (tetracycline) used to treat SIADH because it induces a state of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by inhibiting the actions of ADH in the kidney. This allows for diuresis and less retention of water.
- Vaptans (conivaptan, tolvaptan), which are vasopressin antagonists
- Hypertonic (5%) saline should also be administered if severe CNS changes (e.g. seizures) are present.

It is important that hyponatremia be corrected slowly.  A rapid correction of hyponatremia can lead to **central pontine myelinolysis (aka osmotic demyelination syndrome)**..

<!-- Central pontine myleinolysis pathogenesis -->

Damage to the myelin sheath of the pons leads to the patient becoming "locked in", with intact cognitive function but total muscle paralysis, with the exception of eye blinking..

<!-- SIADH urine vs serum osmolarity -->

In SIADH, urine osmolarity is greater than serum osmolarity..
