## Carpal Tunnel

<!-- carpal tunnel diagnosing study -->

Compression of the median nerve in **carpal tunnel syndrome** (CTS) results in loss of myelination. Axonal loss may also occur if the compression is severe. **Nerve conduction studies** (NCS) can confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of CTS by  demonstrating slowed conduction along the nerve at the level of the  carpal tunnel. Reduced amplitudes indicate axonal loss.  Electromyography (EMG) is frequently combined with NCS and may show  denervation of muscles innervated by the median nerve with relative  sparing of those that are not.

NCS and EMG are  indicated for patients with chronic or refractory CTS who are being  considered for surgery. They are not usually needed in the initial  diagnosis (which is typically based on clinical features) but can be  considered if the diagnosis is uncertain.
