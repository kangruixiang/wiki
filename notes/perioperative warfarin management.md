In patients with a mechanical prosthetic valve undergoing elective surgery, the decision to continue or hold warfarin anticoagulation is based on the risk of systemic thromboembolism (risk factors and type/location of prosthetic valve) and the risk of post-procedure bleeding (type of surgery).  The presence of a mechanical prosthetic **mitral valve** puts the patient at a high risk for systemic thromboembolism.  In patients undergoing low risk surgical procedures, such as dental extraction, warfarin anticoagulation is associated with a minimal risk of serious bleeding and should be continued through the procedure.
