In patients with a mechanical prosthetic valve undergoing elective surgery, the decision to continue or hold warfarin anticoagulation is based on the risk of systemic thromboembolism (risk factors and type/location of prosthetic valve) and the risk of post-procedure bleeding (type of surgery).  The presence of a mechanical prosthetic **mitral valve** puts the patient at a high risk for systemic thromboembolism.  In patients undergoing low risk surgical procedures, such as dental extraction, warfarin anticoagulation is associated with a minimal risk of serious bleeding and should be continued through the procedure.

This patient on warfarin due to his mechanical valve is scheduled for a high-bleeding-risk procedure (ie, endoscopic ultrasound **with** biopsy).  A **mechanical bileaflet aortic valve** is considered either a moderate-thrombotic-risk condition or, when accompanied by ≥1 additional risk factor for stroke (eg, **hypertension**), a **high-thrombotic-risk condition**.  The generally recommended approach in patients with moderate or high thrombotic risk is to hold warfarin for 5 days until the **INR falls <1.5** and then perform the procedure.  Warfarin can usually be resumed the evening following the procedure with **no need for bridging**.

In contrast to the high rate of blood flow through the aortic valve, the relatively stagnant blood flow surrounding the mitral valve creates **very high thrombotic risk** in patients with a mechanical mitral valve.  For patients with a very-high-risk thrombotic condition, perioperative bridging with low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin is indicated; warfarin is typically held 5 days prior to the procedure, and heparin is started once the INR is <2.0 (rather than <1.5) **(Choice D)**.  Heparin should be stopped the day of the procedure and then restarted 24-48 hours afterward, in combination with warfarin, when adequate hemostasis has been achieved.

Patients undergoing low-bleeding-risk procedures (eg, carpal tunnel repair, tooth extraction, endoscopy without biopsy) can often proceed without any change in anticoagulation regimen.
