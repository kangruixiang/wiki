This patient with **diabetic peripheral neuropathy** has developed foot erythema, warmth, and edema following minor trauma (eg, bumping the foot), suggesting **acute neuropathic (Charcot) arthropathy**.  Acute neuropathic arthropathy is characterized by an ==exaggerated, local inflammatory response that is usually triggered by minor trauma== (often unbeknownst to the patient).

X-rays during the acute phase of neuropathic arthropathy typically reveal only soft tissue swelling without bony changes.  Early recognition of acute neuropathic arthropathy and **treatment** with a **==foot cast==** reduce edema and help the patient **avoid weight bearing**, thereby protecting the foot from further injury.  The cast is typically changed every 1-2 weeks to allow for resolving edema.

As inflammation subsides, a gradual return to protected weight bearing (eg, orthotic walker) followed by well-fitting shoes with orthotic shoe inserts can help prevent _chronic_ neuropathic arthropathy caused by continued trauma.  Chronic neuropathic arthropathy is characterized by significant, irreversible abnormalities in bone and skin/soft tissue.
