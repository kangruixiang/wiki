<!-- indications for cardiac resynchronization therapy -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/20220615150550.png)

CRT is most effective in heart failure patients in sinus rhythm and with **==QRS duration ≥150 msec==**.  CRT is also ==reasonable== for patients with QRS duration >==120 msec and <150 msec==; the benefit of CRT in this group is clinically significant but less substantial.

CRT improves left ventricular performance by restoring a more normal sequence of ventricular depolarization and contraction in patients with prolonged QRS duration. Biventricular pacing has been shown to improve exercise tolerance, reduce the need for hospitalization, and decrease overall mortality. ==Implantable cardioverter defibrillators== are also beneficial in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction by decreasing the risk of sudden death.
