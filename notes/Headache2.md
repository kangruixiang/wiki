# Headache

<!-- ignore.. -->

**Cluster headaches** are a type of chronic headache that occurs at the same time each day, which occur for days to weeks. The clusters of painful headache episodes are separated by periods of remission.

**Males** are more likely to have cluster headaches than females.

<!-- cluster headache pathogenesis.. -->

The pathogenesis of cluster headache is thought to be due to **aberrant activation of trigeminal-hypothalamic pathways**.

<!-- cluster headache symptoms.. -->

Occurs at the same time each day, which occur for days to weeks. The clusters of painful headache episodes are separated by periods of remission.

Symptoms of cluster headaches include severe **unilateral periorbital pain**. The pain is described as a boring or drilling sensation. Cluster headaches are associated with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms (e.g. ptosis, miosis, lacrimation, rhinorrhea).

Cluster headaches are often associated with **Horner syndrome** (which includes ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis), lacrimation, and nasal congestion.

They can last from **15 to 180 minutes** and classically awaken patients from sleep.

<!-- cluster headache treatment.. -->

**100% oxygen** (preferred) or **subcutaneous sumatriptan** are the first-line abortive treatments for acute cluster headache.

**Verapamil** is the first-line treatment for patients with chronic cluster headaches.

Alternative agents include prednisone (especially in patients with active cluster periods <2 months), lithium, ergotamine, and topiramate.

# Tension

<!-- ignore.. -->

**Tension headaches** are a diffuse, mild to moderate headache that is often described as **feeling like there’s a tight band around the head**. It is the **most common type of headache**.

Tension headaches affect **females** more often than males.

<!-- tension headache triggers.. -->

Factors that precipitate tension headaches include **stress and fatigue**. (death of family member)

<!-- tension headache symptoms.. -->

Pain from tension headaches is usually **bilateral** (unlike migraines and cluster headaches), with a feeling of **tightness and occipital or neck pain**. It is also associated with anxiety. Unlike migraines and cluster headaches, **tension headaches have a variable duration.**

<!-- tension headache treatment.. -->

Treatment of tension headaches includes:

- **NSAIDs**
- **Amitriptyline**
- **Ergotamine, dihydroergotamine**
- **Sumatriptan, zolmitriptan**
- **Relaxation exercises**

# Trigeminal Neuralgia

<!-- trigeminal neuralgia pathogenesis.. -->

**Trigeminal neuralgia** is head and **facial pain along the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve distribution (most commonly V2 and/or V3)**.

It is thought to be caused by **compression or irritation of the trigeminal nerve root**.

## Symptoms

<!-- trigeminal neuralgia symptoms and triggers.. -->

The presentation of **trigeminal neuralgia** includes **sudden severe pain in the maxillary and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve**.

Pain may be induced by stimulating a “trigger zone,” which is an **area that when lightly touched stimulates an attack**.

<!-- trigeminal neuralgia bilateral causes.. -->

**Multiple sclerosis** (MS), an autoimmune demyelinating central nervous system disorder, is one of the few conditions that may present with trigeminal neuralgia **bilaterally**.  This occurs due to **demyelination of the nucleus** of the trigeminal nerve or the nerve root, which leads to improper signaling of the nerve and paroxysms of severe pain.  This patient's episode of right hand numbness that lasted 2 weeks and spontaneously improved was likely her first symptom of MS.

<!-- trigeminal neuralgia vs shingles.. -->

Herpes zoster is caused by nerve inflammation from viral reactivation, leading to neuritis followed by a dermatomal vesicular rash.  **When the trigeminal nerve is involved, it is usually the V1 branch** (herpes zoster ophthalmicus), which can lead to **blindness**.  In a healthy patient, herpes zoster usually involves one dermatome and is **unlikely to present bilaterally**.

## Diagnosis

<!-- trigeminal neuralgia diagnosis.. -->

In some cases MRI can be used to **identify lesions related to nerve compression** in those patients presenting with trigeminal neuralgia.

<!-- trigeminal neuralgia treatment.. -->

**Carbamazepine** is the drug of choice for patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Other medications include:

- Phenytoin
- Gabapentin
- Valproic acid
- Clonazepam

In some cases, **surgical decompression** of the nerve proves helpful.

# Concussion

<!-- concussion is, cause.. -->

A concussion is a **traumatic brain injury that temporarily disrupts brain function**. A concussion is caused by **blunt trauma** such as a blow to the head.

## Symptoms

<!-- concussion symptoms... -->

A loss of consciousness is **not required** for the diagnosis.

Symptoms of a concussion include **dizziness, confusion, trouble concentrating, headache, memory loss, balance or coordination problems.**

Be aware of symptoms that suggest increased intracranial pressure such as **vomiting, focal neurologic deficits, or delirium.**

## Diagnosis

<!-- concussion diagnosis.. -->

Diagnosis and clinical workup of a concussion may involve a **CT scan and thorough neurologic evaluation** to assess for possible blood or swelling in the brain.

Concussed patients are often kept under observation in the hospital or at home to watch for the development of more serious neurological problems.

**Subdural and epidural hematomas** must be ruled out.

## Management

<!-- concussion management.. -->

Typically, these symptoms resolve with symptomatic treatment within a few weeks to months following TBI; however, some patients may have persistent symptoms lasting ≥6 months.

Treatment of a concussion involves **mental and physical rest**, use **acetaminophen for headaches** (ibuprofen or aspirin increase risk for bleeding).
