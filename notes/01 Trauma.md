## Blunt

- always do FAST
	- positive: OR
- CT as alternative
	- blood/air: OR
- KUB: not right
- DPL: not right
- Pelvis, abdomen, thigh hold the most amount of blood, enough to die
- causes of bleed
	- ruptured liver, most common, shredded by ligament with force stop. Repair or lobectomy, pringle maneuver
	- ruptured spleen: has capsule. Can usually pack it and repair. Can also resect if bad. Vaccinate afterwards
	- diaphragm: bowel in chest. OR
	- ruptured viscous: air under diaphragm on KUB. Free air on CT at top of scan.
- Pelvic fx
	- enormous amount of trauma. MVC
	- hip rocking: pain, instability. CT scan
	- external fixation. Not OR unless in peritoneum.
	- look for urethral trauma, high riding prostate, blood at meatus. Don't put in folley. Diagnosis with retrograde urethrogram.
	- Rectal injury: proctoscope
	- ureteral injury: assess with intravenous pyelogram
