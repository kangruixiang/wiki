## Tricuspid Stenosis

In tricuspid stenosis **narrowing of the tricuspid valve** results in **a persistent diastolic pressure gradient between the right atrium to the right ventricle**.

The most common cause of acquired tricuspid stenosis is **rheumatic fever**.

Congenital tricuspid atresia typically presents with **early cyanosis** and **additional associated congenital heart defects** which determine the severity and phenotype.

The presentation of clinically significant tricuspid stenosis depends on whether or not there is **accompanying mitral valve disease**.

Most patients with clinically significant tricuspid stenosis do also have accompanying mitral valve pathology as well as some degree of tricuspid regurgitation, and present with **abdominal discomfort**, **hepatomegaly**, and **hepatic congestion**. Patients may also complain of a **fluttering sensation in the neck** caused by tall jugular venous A waves.

In the _absence_of mitral valve disease, a patient with clinically significant tricuspid stenosis may present with **fatigue** and **signs of systemic venous hypertension** which are _characteristically out of proportion to the dyspnea__._

Tricuspid stenosis (TS) causes a **diastolic rumble at the left fourth interspace**. As in mitral stenosis, it may be accompanied by an **opening snap**.

The intensity of the murmur increases with maneuvers that **increase preload** and enhance the diastolic pressure gradient, including **inspiration**, **leg raise**,**inhalation of amyl nitrate**, and **squatting**.

Although Carvalloâ€™s sign (**increased murmur intensity with inspiration**) is most often associated with tricuspid regurgitation, it is a feature of all right-sided heart murmurs--including tricuspid stenosis.

Chest X-ray may show **dilatation of the right atrium**.

Echocardiography with doppler demonstrates **limited mobility of the tricuspid leaflets**, diastolic doming of the valve, and high-pressure turbulent flow across the narrowed opening.

Isolated, **asymptomatic tricuspid stenosis does not require treatment**; however, patients with **symptoms of systemic venous hypertension and congestion should be considered for balloon valvotomy**.

If there is **accompanying symptomatic mitral or aortic valve disease for which valvuloplasty is indicated in a patient with signs and symptoms of tricuspid stenosis**, then replacement of the tricuspid valve is indicated at the time of surgery.
