This patient has iron and vitamin D deficiencies despite consuming a nutritious diet, suggesting a malabsorption disorder. In a young patient with **multi-nutrient malabsorption**, the most likely explanation is **celiac disease** (gluten-sensitive enteropathy). The likelihood of celiac disease is even higher in this patient with vitiligo and a family history of hypothyroidism (**associated autoimmune disorders**). Although celiac disease is classically associated with prominent gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, a substantial subset of patients develops malabsorption with minimal or no gastrointestinal symptoms.

Screening for celiac disease is performed by checking the **anti-endomysial antibody** and **anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody** levels. Simultaneously checking both antibody levels increases the sensitivity for diagnosing the disease. The gold standard for diagnosis is small intestinal biopsy.

<!-- celiac disease complications -->

Patients with **untreated celiac disease** are at risk for developing **enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma** (EATL), an aggressive hematologic malignancy that primarily affects the proximal **jejunum**.  Manifestations typically begin with abdominal pain and B symptoms (eg, weight loss, fatigue, fever).  Bowel obstruction, bowel perforation, and gastrointestinal bleeding are common as the disease progresses.

Most patients with EATL present late in the disease process when curative options are limited.  As such, prognosis tends to be poor with median survival of only 10 months.
