This patient’s underlying risk factors (elderly age, COPD, nursing home resident), clinical presentation (confusion, high fever with ==bradycardia==), laboratory abnormalities (hyponatremia, ==thrombocytopenia==, ==elevated LFTs==), and ==failure to respond to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam== are strongly suggestive of _Legionella_ pneumonia.  _Legionella_ species are facultative intracellular gram-negative bacilli whose natural habitats are aquatic bodies (e.g., lakes, streams, man-made reservoirs, standing water).

There are no pathognomonic or highly specific clinical, laboratory, or radiological features for Legionella infection.  The most common x-ray finding is a ==unilobar infiltrate== that progresses to consolidation.  Patients with suspected _Legionella_ pneumonia should have both a ==urinary _Legionella_ antigen test== (detects only _L. pneumophila_, serogroup 1) and a ==respiratory sample== (e.g., sputum, BAL) for _Legionella_ culture.  Suspected or proven _Legionella_ pneumonia requires treatment with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g., ==levofloxacin==) or “newer” macrolide (e.g., ==azithromycin==), as both have good lung penetration with potent intracellular activity.

Ampicillin and piperacillin-tazobactam are both beta-lactam antibiotics and are ineffective against _Legionella_.  Ampicillin is commonly used to treat _Listeria_, which causes meningitis/sepsis but not pneumonia.

Linezolid is approved for treating MRSA pneumonia and is as effective as vancomycin.  However, vancomycin and linezolid are not effective against _Legionella_.

Metronidazole is effective for anaerobic aspiration pneumonia but not for _Legionella_.
