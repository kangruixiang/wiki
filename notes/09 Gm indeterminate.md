- Originally rickettsia species, now its own
- red barn: Gram negative
- Ram inside barn with lock: Obligate intracellular organism
- Walnuts with poop: Contained in spore like structures in animal feces

<!-- Coxiella transmission -->

- Walnuts with poop: Contained in spore like structures in animal feces
- Dust cloud: Transmitted to humans via aerosol transmission, farm animals are major reservoir

- White, clean sheep: No rash caused
- Q horn; Q-fever
- coughing farmer: Pneumonia
- hitting head: Headache

- Self limiting

# Mycoplasma Pneumoniae

<!-- Mycoplasma pneumoniae features. PM features -->

- Outside, no walls: "No cell wall, can't appear on gram stain"
- cholesterol rings on goal net:  Cell membrane contains cholesterol, stabilize membrane and more flexible

<!-- mycoplasma pneumoniae demographics -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/xO6jkMt.jpg)

- military uniform: Common in military recruits living in close quarters
- <30: Commonly occurs in young adults

<!-- mycoplasma pneumoniae labs and agar. What's so special about its symptom -->

- RBC on ground bound by IgM snow flakes: IgM cold agglutinins cause agglutination/lysis of red blood cells
- Don't eat on ice: "Eaton's agar"
- patchy sky: X-ray shows reticulonodular or "patchy" infiltrate, appears much worse than patients seem clinically
- referee walking: Walking pneumonia, pt not as sick as X ray shows
- target: Erythema multiforme. Target lesions

<!-- mycoplasma pneumoniae treatment -->

- Crows: Macrolide for treatment because no cell wall

# Rickettsia species

<!-- Rickettsia species features, gm stain, shape, why is it intracellular? -->

- Inside stadium: Obligate intracellular organism
- All white ppl: Poor gram staining. Giemsa stain for visualization
- pink tennis balls:  Weakly gram negative
- deflated tennis balls: Coccobacillary shape
- Coach shirt: Unable to produce CoA, gets it from eukaryotic cells
- NAD+ bottle:  Unable to produce NAD+, important for bacterial growth and reproduction, steal from eukaryotic

<!-- Rickettsia lab test -->

- Will and Felix: Weil-Felix agglutination test for Rickettsial infections, cross reaction between rickettsia and proteus vulgaris

<!-- Rickettsia symptoms and treatment -->

- Felix sweating/touching head: Headache and fever in early Rickettsial infection
- Rash may be associated with vasculitis
- broken, bright red net and rackets: Vasculitis and inflammation/destruction
- Tires: Doxycycline for treatment

- Coach with military hat: Affects military camp recruits and prisoners of war (close contact with poor hygiene
- football shaped like louse: Spread by louse, defecates near bite spread to blood by scratching.
- The outbreak board: Illness is called epidemic typhus (more widespread than endemic)

<!-- prowazekii symptoms -->

- football formation: Rash starts at trunk, and spreads outward towards extremities
- players red except helmet, hands, feet: Rash spares hands, head, and feet
- Tackled player: Causes myalgia and arthalgia
- coughing from dirt: Causes pneumonia
- confused guy: Encephalitis, with and confusion. can cause coma if very serious

## rickettsii

<!-- rickettsii transmission, difference from prowazekii -->

- Rock with legs, derma center arena: Transmitted by direct bite of Dermacentor ticks (sport center)
- Transmitted by direct bite of Dermacentor ticks

<!-- rickettsii symptoms -->

- climber at bottom with no rash: Rash not immediate, incubation period between 2-14 days
