# Overview

## Alarming symptoms

<!-- back pain alarming symptoms -->

- alarming symptoms:
	- bowel, bladder incontinence
	- saddle anesthesia
	- any FND that's new or rapidly progressing

<!-- ignore -->

- path: muscle spasm
- pt: young, male, heavy lifting
- symptoms: back hurts, no alarming symptoms, "delt like," asymmetric/unilateral
- diagnosis: clinical
- treatment: exercise, NSAIDS.,

<!-- spinal cord compression vs infarction.. -->

- infarction: rapid onset
- compression: slow progressive onset

## Workup

<!-- someone comes in with lower back pain, workup -->

Someone comes in with lower back pain:

- if alarming symptoms, think **cord compression**:
	- Give IV steroids ASAP
	- Xray or jump to MRI if giving steroids
	- Decompress the compression
		- hematoma: drain
		- abscess: incision drainage + abx
		- cancer: radiation
		- fracture: surgery
- if nonspecific, vague complaints, think **musculoskeletal pain**:
	- NSAIDS, exercise
	- Do not pick bedrest
	- No imaging needed
	- reassess in 4 weeks
		- improvement: continue
		- failed improvement or if positive symptoms: **something else**
			- Xray
			- if negative Xray, MRI
			- some form of surgery

# Cord Compression

<!-- spinal cord compression causes, symptoms, management.. -->

- causes
	- Spinal injury (eg, motor vehicle crash)
	- Malignancy (eg, lung, breast, prostate cancers; myeloma)
	- Infection (eg, epidural abscess with IV drug users or diabetes)
- Symptoms
	- Gradually worsening, severe local back pain
	- **Pain worse** in the recumbent position/at **night**
	- Early signs: Symmetric lower extremity weakness, hypoactive/absent deep-tendon reflexes
	- Late signs: Bilateral Babinski reflex, decreased rectal sphincter tone, paraparesis/paraplegia with increased deep-tendon reflexes, sensory loss

Most patients present with **progressively worsening back pain**.  Pain is usually **worse in the recumbent position** (due to distension of the epidural venous plexus when lying down) in contrast to back pain from degenerative joint disease, which improves with recumbency.  **Bilateral lower-extremity weakness** is present in about 60% of patients.  **Sensory loss** below a spinal level and **gait ataxia** may occur.  **Paraplegia and bowel or bladder dysfunctions** (eg, fecal or urinary retention/incontinence) are late findings.  Examination shows **focal point tenderness** in the spine, **exaggerated deep-tendon reflexes** in the legs, and **upgoing plantar reflexes**.

In the acute phase of spinal cord injury, patients can develop spinal shock and have absence of reflexes and flaccid paraplegia.

## Management

- Emergency MRI
- Intravenous glucocorticoids
- Radiation-oncology & neurosurgery consultation

<!-- spinal cord compression vs infarction.. -->

- infarction: rapid onset
- compression: slow progressive onset

# MSK Pain

<!-- msk pain path, pt, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment -->

- path: muscle spasm
- pt: young, male, heavy lifting
- symptoms: back hurts, no alarming symptoms, "delt like," asymmetric/unilateral
- diagnosis: clinical
- treatment: exercise, NSAIDS.,

# Something Else

## Disc Herniation

<!-- disc herniation path, pt, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment -->

- path: nucleus pulposus pinching nerve
- pt: 30-50 yo male, heavy lifting
- symptoms: sciatica, lightning shock pain down leg, positive straight leg test
- diagnosis: Xray probably negative, MRI next
- treatment: depends on severity/lifestyle
	- neurosurgery > conservative at 6 mo (probably atheletes)
	- neurosurgery = conservative at 1 yo (probably older guy just wants to live).,

## Osteophyte

<!-- osteophyte path, pt, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

- path: bony spur growing into canal and pinches nerve
- pt: older male, no heavy lifting
- symptoms: asymmetric, unilateral, sciatica, + SLR
- diagnosis: Xray probably negative, MRI showing bone spur
- treatment: surgery. Not going to get better with conservative

## Compression Fracture

<!-- compression fracture path, pt, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment -->

- path: osteoporosis
- pt: >50, female, falls
- symptoms: vertebral step-off, pinpoint tenderness
- diagnosis: xray probably positive, MRI better
- treatment: surgery, dexa scan for osteoporosis.,

## Spinal Stenosis

<!-- spinal stenosis path, pt, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment -->

- path: narrowing of canal, pinching of nerve
- pt: old, male or female
- symptoms: pseudoclaudication in butt/thighs, positional (claudication when walking around upright)
- diagnosis: xray probably negative, MRI better
- treatment: surgery, laminectomy.,

## Others

<!-- ignore.. -->

- women in menstrual cycle with lower back pain, treatment with NSAIDS

- back pain with abdominal pulsating mass: aortic aneurysm

## Back Pain

<!-- spinal stenosis vs nerve root irritation -->

The characteristics of the back pain described in  this scenario are typical for nerve root irritation. The pain is  frequently brief and shooting, and radiates along the corresponding  nerve distribution. It can be provoked by forward bending, coughing, or  straining, and it diminishes on lying down. A positive straight-leg  raising test at a 60 degree angle or less is characteristic.

Spinal stenosis is responsible for neurogenic claudication. In contrast to  radiculopathy, the pain in spinal stenosis increases with extension of  the spine and decreases with flexion of the spine.

<!-- spinal stenosis dx -->

The diagnosis of spinal stenosis in a patient with symptoms is best  confirmed by using MRI of the spine. The encroaching of osteophytes at  the facet joints, hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, and protrusion  of intervertebral disks results in a narrowing of the spinal canal. In  some patients, gait disturbance is so prominent that they complain of  having "spaghetti legs" or walking "like a drunken sailor." The  preservation of pedal pulses helps distinguish this disease from  vascular claudication.
