# Psychosis Ddx

<!-- MDD with psychosis symptoms, treatment.. -->

This is a severe subtype of unipolar major depression in which the depressive episode is **accompanied by delusions and/or hallucinations**, typically with **depressive themes** (eg, deserving punishment, worthlessness, nihilism). E.g.:

- "Something is very wrong with my brain since my wife died 6 months ago."  Over the past month, he has become convinced that he has brain cancer and is being punished for sins he committed as a young man.
- He denies suicidal ideation but says, "It doesn't matter because I am dying anyway and the end is near."

Identification of psychotic features is important as psychotic depression is treated differently than nonpsychotic depression.  First-line treatment of major depressive disorder with psychotic features is combination pharmacotherapy with an **antidepressant** and **antipsychotic** or **electroconvulsive therapy**.

## Schizoaffective

<!-- schizoaffective disorder vs MDD with psychosis.. -->

Schizoaffective disorder is distinguished from major depressive disorder (MDD) with psychosis in the following way:

- **Schizoaffective is psychosis with intermittent mood disorders**. Psychosis in the absence of a mood disorder rules out MDD.
- **MDD with psychosis is a constant mood disorder with intermittent psychosis** (delusions/hallucinations).

Schizoaffective disorder must be differentiated from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder:

- If mood symptoms occur in schizophrenia, they are typically present for a small portion of the illness.  In contrast, schizoaffective's mood symptoms appear to be present for a significant portion of illness.
- In bipolar I disorder, psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during manic or depressive episodes.  The persistence of hallucinations when patient's mood is stable rules out a bipolar I diagnosis.

## GAD vs Adjustment

<!-- GAD vs Adjustment.. -->

- Adjustment: exclude GAD first
- GAD: > 6 mo, multiple areas of life

# Questions

<!-- A 32-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his mother.  She says that he has stayed up every night for the past week, praying and shouting that he is the Messiah.  He speaks rapidly without interruption and believes that he has special powers to end all wars and save mankind.  He shakes his head in response to voices, saying that there is a fight between good and evil and that he must "drown out the devil."  The patient has a history of psychiatric illness since his early twenties, when he was discharged from the military due to severe depression and suicidal ideation.  At that time, he heard voices blaming him for all the suffering in war.  He has been hospitalized for numerous depressive episodes over the past 10 years.  Between hospitalizations, he has had brief periods lasting several weeks during which his depression stabilizes, but he has continued to hear the voices of God and the devil.  The patient lives with his mother and is able to work stocking groceries, but he spends most of his time at home alone.  He has been prescribed risperidone, but his mother is unsure if he takes it regularly.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?.. -->

Schizoaffective

<!-- A 28-year-old woman comes to the office for a follow-up visit to monitor her psychiatric medications.  The patient says, "I am not feeling depressed for the first time in years, but the voices just won't go away."  She hears the voices several times a week, which say she is "stupid and ugly."  Two months previously, the patient was hospitalized for increasing auditory hallucinations and fears that her boss and coworkers had been replaced by imposters.  During that same period, she felt increasingly hopeless and had so little energy that she found it difficult to get out of bed.  The patient had lost 8 pounds, slept 12 hours a day, and was preoccupied with feelings of worthlessness and guilt that she was destroying her family.  She was treated with fluoxetine and aripiprazole and discharged.  Since discharge, the patient's mood and energy have gradually improved and she recently returned to work part-time.  However, during the past month she has continued to hear voices and remains convinced that her boss is not who he says he is.  The patient usually drinks 1 or 2 glasses of wine daily but has recently increased this to 4 glasses daily to "drown out" the voices.  Which of the following most likely explains the course of this woman's illness?.. -->

Schizoaffective
