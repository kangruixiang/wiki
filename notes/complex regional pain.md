## Complex regional pain

<!-- complex regional pain syndrome cause, sx, stages -->

This patient presents with knee pain, swelling,  decreased range of motion, skin changes, and vasomotor changes after a  recent injury consistent with **complex regional pain syndrome** (CRPS). This syndrome was previously known as reflex sympathetic  dystrophy, algodystrophy, causalgia, Sudeck atrophy, transient  osteoporosis, and acute atrophy of bone. Usually occurring after an  injury, CRPS presents with **pain out of proportion to the injury**, temperature change, edema, and abnormal skin color. Type I CRPS (90%  of CRPS cases) occurs without a definable nerve lesion, while type II  occurs with a definable nerve lesion. The pathogenesis is likely due to an **injury causing increased sensitivity** to sympathetic nerves, an abnormal response to and sensation of pain, and increased  neuropeptide release causing burning pain to light touch (allodynia).

Typically, CRPS occurs in 3 stages. Stage 1 includes burning pain, edema, and  vasomotor changes in a limb after injury. Stage 2 includes progression  of edema, skin thickening, and muscle wasting. Stage 3 is the most  severe and includes limited range of motion and bone demineralization on x-ray. Diagnosis can be confirmed by either autonomic testing that  measures increased resting sweat output or magnetic resonance imaging  that looks for the above changes. The treatment for CRPS is regional  sympathetic nerve block or intravenous regional anesthesia. This  patient appears to have Stage 3 disease and would benefit from a local  nerve block.
