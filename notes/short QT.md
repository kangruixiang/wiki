Short QT syndrome is a rare and genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by a short QT interval (QT <340 ms or ==QTc <350 ms==). It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Patients can present with ==atrial and ventricular arrhythmias== (including atrial fibrillation, polymorphic VT, and VF) and syncope. Patients with short QT syndrome are considered to be at very high risk for SCD; therefore, ==ICD placement== is recommended in all patients.
