# CLABSI

- Look at time to positivity: for central line infection, culture becomes positive 2 hours from central line blood compared to peripheral blood

<!--  CLABSI causes, bacteria, management, rx, duration -->

- cause:
	- central line, HD catheters
- bacteria:
	- coag neg staph
	- staph aureus
	- GNR
- management:
	- 2 sets of blood cultures, ideally one from a peripheral site and one from the central catheter
	- Empiric antibiotic therapy should then be initiated with **vancomycin** plus **cefepime** (or gentamicin).
- Catheter removal is indicated if any of the following are present:
	- Severe sepsis
	- Hemodynamic instability
	- Evidence of metastatic infection (eg, endocarditis)
	- Pus at the exit site of the catheter
	- Continued symptoms after 72 hours of empiric antibiotics
- Infected CVCs should be removed. CVC removal is particularly important for _S. aureus_, _P. aeruginosa_, and _Candid_a species infections.
- Patients who do not require catheter removal should have the catheter changed over a guidewire (once afebrile and clinically stable if there is no evidence of tunnel tract involvement) or antibiotic lock therapy after each hemodialysis session.  These measures are required to prevent recurrent infection.
- The duration of therapy for most cases of uncomplicated nonâ€“_S. aureus_ CLABSI is 7 to 14 days. _S. aureus_ CLABSI is usually treated for at least 4 weeks; however, shorter-term therapy (2 weeks) may be considered in select patients who have immediate catheter removal with resolution of fever and bacteremia within 72 hours of starting appropriate therapy and who have no implanted prosthetic devices, no evidence of endocarditis by echocardiography (preferably transesophageal), no evidence of suppurative thrombophlebitis, no evidence of metastatic infection, and neither diabetes mellitus nor immunosuppression.
- Bacteremia clearance should be confirmed with follow-up blood cultures. If bacteremia persists after CVC removal and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, evaluation for a deeper source of infection, including endocarditis, should be performed. All patients with candidemia should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist to rule out the presence of candida endophthalmitis within 1 to 2 weeks.

Antibiotic lock therapy, a method for sterilizing the catheter lumen, involves instilling high concentrations of antibiotics into the catheter lumen for extended periods of time.
