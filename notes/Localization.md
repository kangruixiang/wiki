# Localization

## Dominant

- **Wernicke**: actual coding/decoding of language for brain. Aphasia can understand things except language.
	- Repetition: bad
	- Comprehension test: bad. Can't decode in brain. 1, 2, 3 step commands (show 3 fingers with right hand)
	- Fluency: intact
	- Naming: bad. Semantic paraphasia: semantic. Meant to say marker but says something else (phonetic paraphasia: words that sounds similar 'parker' instead of 'marker')
- **Transcortical sensory aphasia**, supramarginal gyrus: intact repetition, affected comprehension, fluency intact, naming bad
- **Arcuate** fasciculus, angular gyrus, conductive aphasia: repetition bad, comprehension good, fluency good, naming bad
- **Broca**: repetition bad, comprehension good, fluency bad, naming bad
- **Transcortical motor aphasia**, premotor: repetition good, comprehension good, fluency bad, naming bad
- **Alexia without agraphia**: occipital, PCA, impaired visual stimulus to Wernicke's
- **Cortical sensation**: only in cortex, not subcortex. Write in hands. Put objects in hands. 2 point discriminations
- **Frontal eye fields**: Moves eyes contralateral. Eyes move towards affected side. Case: right weakness, eyes move to left.
	- Seizures: Increased FEF, eyes move towards opposite of seizure. Case: right weakness, eyes move right
- **Apraxia**: frontal/parietal lesion cause loss of macros of daily functioning (e.g. light a match)

|               | Repetition | Comprehension | Fluency | Naming |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Wernicke      | -          | -             | +       | -      |
| Supramarginal | +          | -             | +       | -      |
| Arcuate       | -          | +             | +       | -      |
| Broca         | -          | +             | -       | -      |
| Premotor      | +          | +             | -       | -      |

## Non dominant

- **Receptive aprosody**: loss of understanding of non verbal language (monotonous speech)
- **Hemineglect**: looks to one side, lying on one side of bed and leaning towards one side, doesn't respond on one side, doesn't recognize own hand
	- vision: can use blink reflex to differentiate from hemianopsia
	- sensory: loss of sensory on side of lesion

# Cerebellum

## Midbrain

- CN 3 palsy, contralateral hemiparesis, tremor/dystonia from red nucleus lesion
- compressive lesion: blown pupil
- ischemic lesion: normal pupil

## Pons

- bulbar nerves: dysarthria if dorsal pons lesion, CN 6/7 if ventral pons

## Medulla

- lateral: 5, spinothalamic, sympathetic tract, vestibular
	- ipsilateral face, contralateral sensory loss, **vertigo** (most common)/ataxia, ipsilateral horners (lights off to see difference)
