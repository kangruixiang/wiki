## AS

- latent disease and once develop symptoms, short life span < 2 years
- aortic valve replacement only treatment
- surgical AVR mortality in 30 days goes up with age, >10% with people > 80 [](https://i.imgur.com/H1Nl885.png)![](https://i.imgur.com/H1Nl885.png)

balloon valvuloplasty

- causes severe AR
- stroke risk
- marginal improvement in area
- no benefit with AS, significant recurrence

- SAVR for low and intermediate risk
- TAVR approved for low risk in 2019
- Pacemaker rate to 10-20%
- 73% TAVI patients have new embolic lesions by MRI. Protected TAVR on study to see if can catch emboli

## Guideline

- severe AS or symptoms = AVR

	- SAVR for younger pt < 65 with longer life expectancy
	- > 80 or life expectancy < 10, TAVR
- asymptomatic patients: follow same recommendations

## asymptomatic patients

- TAVR if exercise stress test, changes on echo, EF < 50%
- Early TAVR study, EVOLVED trial: asymptomatic patients undergo TAVR
