# juvenile idiopathic arthritis

- related: [[pediatric]]

This patient with midline spinal point tenderness most likely has a **vertebral compression fracture** due to poorly controlled **juvenile idiopathic arthritis** (JIA)-associated osteoporosis.  JIA is a chronic (>6 weeks), relapsing-remitting inflammatory condition that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness of multiple joints.  The disease varies in severity and may be difficult to control.  Treatment includes a combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, naproxen), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (eg, methotrexate), and glucocorticoids.

Prolonged glucocorticoid use is generally avoided due to side effects.  However, patients with refractory JIA may require short courses of low-dose systemic glucocorticoids to treat flares.  The combination of frequent systemic **glucocorticoid** use and continued **joint destruction** from unremitting disease may result in **decreased bone mineral density** (ie, osteoporosis).

Low bone mass associated with **osteoporosis** increases the risk for fractures.  Any pressure (eg, coughing, bending) or minor trauma can result in a pathologic fracture, and vertebral compression fractures are among the most common.  Localized back pain that worsens with movement is typical for these fractures, as seen in this patient.  Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is used to diagnose osteoporosis and predict fracture risk.  Supplemental calcium and vitamin D are recommended to optimize bone health.
