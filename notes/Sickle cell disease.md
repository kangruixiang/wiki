## Symptoms

This patient with **symmetric swelling** and **pain** of the  **hands and feet** in the setting of known **sickle cell disease** (SCD) has **dactylitis** (hand-foot syndrome). Dactylitis, resulting from  **vaso-occlusion** of the blood vessels supplying the metacarpals and  metatarsals, may be the earliest manifestation of SCD in **young  children** (ages 6 months to 4 years). Similar to other vaso-occlusive  episodes, triggers include stress, illness, temperature changes, and  dehydration. Low-grade fever may also be present in addition to pain.  Initial radiographs reveal only soft-tissue swelling; recurrent episodes can lead to a mottled appearance of the bones. Although most children  with SCD are diagnosed by hemoglobin electrophoresis on newborn  screening, the presence of dactylitis in a previously healthy child  should prompt evaluation for SCD.

## Labs

Baseline changes:

- increased bilirubin, reticulocytes
- decreased Hgb
- chronic pain

## Diagnosis

- prenatal screen
- CBC: sickle cells
- Hgb electrophoresis

## Treatment

<!-- sickle cell disease treatment -->

Treatment of dactylitis involves pain control, **hydration**, and  application of **heat**. **Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs**  (NSAIDs) and **oral opioids** are typically initiated for mild to  moderate pain. Because this patient still appears uncomfortable after  treatment with NSAIDs, a short-acting oral opioid (eg, oxycodone) should be given. If the pain fails to improve, intravenous opioids are  indicated.

**(Choice A)** Cold compresses are not recommended as they can trigger local intravascular sickling and worsen vaso-occlusive pain episodes. In contrast, heat packs help by promoting vasodilation.

**(Choices B and E)** Oral codeine and tramadol are contraindicated in children  age <12 because ultra-rapid metabolism of codeine and tramadol  causes an unpredictably high concentration of the active drug in the  body, which can result in respiratory depression and death.

**(Choice C)** Hydroxyurea reduces the frequency of vaso-occlusive episodes in  patients with SCD but may take several months to take effect. It is not used in the treatment of an acute vaso-occlusive episode.
