# oral contraceptives can decrease ovarian cancer risks

- related: [[OBGYN]]

The lifetime risk of ovarian malignancy is 1.4%; epithelial ovarian carcinoma comprises the majority of these diagnoses.  Persistent ovulation causing repeated damage to the epithelial surface of the ovary can result in malignant transformation.  Therefore, women with more ovulatory cycles (eg, early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity) are at increased risk of ovarian cancer.  Conversely, women with fewer ovulatory cycles have a **decreased risk of ovarian cancer**.  In this patient, **combined oral contraceptives** provide contraception and **prevent ovulation**.  In addition, oral contraceptives may suppress the formation of future cysts, although they will not aid in the regression of the cyst already present.
