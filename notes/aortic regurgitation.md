## Aortic Regurgitation

### Pathogenesis

Acute aortic regurgitation is caused by either damage to the valve leaflets or dilation of the aortic root, or both in some cases. In the developed world, the most common causes are:

- **Aortic root enlargement** (usually trauma or aortic dissection)
- **Congenital bicuspid aortic valve**
- **Calcific valve disease**

In the developing world, the most common cause is **rheumatic fever**.

**Connective tissue diseases**, **syphilitic aortitis**, and **aging** can lead to **chronic dilation of the aortic root**, resulting in aortic regurgitation.

### Symptoms

Acute aortic regurgitation presents with the **rapid onset of severe congestive left heart failure**, **cardiovascular collapse**, and manifestations of **cardiogenic shock** (profound hypotension, pallor, and diaphoresis) with a **_thready pulse_** and _normal to reduced pulse pressure_.

In chronic aortic regurgitation, **the left ventricle dilates** to accommodate the volume of the backflow **without increasing filling pressure** or left atrial pressure. These individuals may be asymptomatic until eventually the heart can no longer compensate and symptoms of congestive left heart failure develop.

Since aortic regurgitation leads to congestive left heart failure, it is **exacerbated** by volume overload conditions (such as a high-salt diet) and strenuous exercise.

Aortic regurgitation causes a **high-pitched diastolic murmur**, often with a **_blowing_ quality**, beginning immediately after A2. It may decrescendo or persist throughout diastole, and is **enhanced by the patient leaning forward and holding his breath at end-expiration**.

### PE

The spot at which the murmur is best appreciated depends on the cause of the regurgitation:

- Aortic regurgitation secondary to **valvular insufficiency** produces the characteristic murmur best auscultated along the **_left_ sternal _border_ at the third or fourth interspace**.
- Aortic regurgitation secondary to **aortic root dilatation** produces diastolic murmurs best auscultated along the **_right_ sternal border** or at the **apex**.

The Austin-Flint murmur is a **low-pitched mid- to late-diastolic rumble best heard at the apex** that is associated with aortic regurgitation. It is caused by the turbulence of the anterograde stream from the left atrium competing with retrograde flow across the insufficient aortic valve.

The Austin-Flint murmur is best heard with the patient in the **left lateral decubitus position**, as this brings the left ventricle closer to the chest wall.

The Austin-Flint murmur of chronic aortic regurgitation can be distinguished from the murmur of mitral stenosis by the **_absence_ of the loud S1 and opening snap** which characterize mitral stenosis.

Clinical signs commonly associated with **chronic aortic regurgitation** include:

- Head bobbing (the force of the systolic pressure with each heartbeat causes the head to bob)
- Pulsating nail bed (pulsations are visible in the nail beds due to the widened pulse pressure)
- Water hammer pulse (bounding and forceful pulse that is commonly associated with widened pulse pressure)

Patients with chronic aortic regurgitation have a **widened pulse pressure** (high systolic blood pressure with a low diastolic blood pressure).

### Diagnosis

Electrocardiogram will show **left ventricular hypertrophy**, **left atrial dilation**, and **abnormal repolarization with ST segment depression at rest or during exercise**.

Dilation of the left ventricle leads to an **enlarged cardiac silhouette** and in severe cases aortic dilation on chest x-ray.

Echocardiography shows a **dilated left ventricle with regurgitation** visible on color Doppler, and is the gold standard for diagnosis and staging.

Pulsus bisferiens (or biphasic pulse) refers to 2 strong systolic peaks of the aortic pulse from left ventricular ejection separated by a midsystolic dip.  It can be palpated in patients with significant **aortic regurgitation** (with or without aortic stenosis), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and, occasionally, large patent ductus arteriosus.

Chronic aortic regurgitation is often associated with an **S3 heart sound**.

In **_acute_ onset aortic regurgitation**, rapid decompensation causes **flash pulmonary edema**. In **_chronic_ aortic regurgitation**, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume increases slowly enough that the ventricle is able to remodel, so **pulmonary edema is seen only later**.

### Management

**Medical management** of aortic regurgitation is aimed at **reducing afterload**, but plays a limited role because **symptomatic patients require valve replacement**.

In acute aortic regurgitation patients generally require **emergent valve replacement**. Temporary stabilization may be provided with **IV nitroprusside** to reduce afterload and **dopamine or dobutamine** for inotropic support. _Note that intra-aortic balloon pumps are CONTRAINDICATED because they worsen the retrograde filling of the ventricle when the balloon inflates during diastole. Left-ventricular assist devices (LVADS) provide no therapeutic benefit._

**Surgical replacement of the valve** is indicated for symptomatic patients prior to the development of heart failure. If the aortic root is involved it is simultaneously replaced with a composite graft.

Medical management with a **low-sodium diet**, **ACE inhibitors**, and \*\*calcium channel blockers \*\*(nifedipine) is appropriate for patients with **chronic, asymptomatic aortic regurgitation** and an **ejection fraction > 50%**.

Note that **beta-blockers** are relatively contraindicated due to their tendency to **lengthen diastole**, thereby **worsening the regurgitation**.

Recall that patients with **midsystolic murmurs** (**grade ≤2**) **without associated findings and symptoms** do _not_ require further workup for a murmur.

In contrast, patients with murmurs with any of the following characteristics require further evaluation with echocardiography:

- **Holosystolic murmurs**
- **Diastolic murmurs**
- **Continuous murmurs**
- **Murmurs grade ≥3**
- **Murmurs with concomitant cardiopulmonary symptoms**
