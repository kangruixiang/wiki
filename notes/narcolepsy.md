- Diagnosed by sleep study/polysomnography
	- multiple spontaneous awakenings
	- reduced sleep efficiency (total  sleep time divided by total recording time)
	- reduced latency of rapid eye  movement (REM) sleep.
- Polysomnography can also exclude other causes of  EDS (excessive day time sleepiness) (eg, sleep apnea).

<!-- narcolepsy rx -->

- goal: reduced excessive day time sleepiness
- **modafinil**: novel stimulant, less addictive, first line
- older stimulants: methylphenidate, amphetamines
	- effective but addictive
	- bad side effects
- nonpharmacologic:
	- taking scheduled naps
	- good sleep hygiene

<!-- cataplexy is, treatment -->

- sudden onset of **muscle weakness**
- triggers: intense **emotional episodes** (eg, anger, laughing, surprise)
- occurs in roughly 70% of patients  with narcolepsy.
- Treatment: stimulants, nonpharmacologic
- can be treated with a **serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor** (eg, venlafaxine) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and a tricyclic antidepressant can also be considered.
- **Sodium oxybate** (the salt form of gamma-hydroxybutyrate) can improve nocturnal sleep,  relieve excessive daytime sleepiness and has anti-cataplectic  properties; however, it is rarely used due to abuse potential and  restrictive regulations.
