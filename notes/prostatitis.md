# prostatitis

- related: [[ID]]

<!-- bacterial prostatitis sx, dx, rx. Acute vs chronic vs UTI -->

- Sx: fever, dysuria, frequency, pyuria, bacteriuria
- Ddx: **UTI with cystitis** vs **acute bacterial prostatitis**
	- UTI: usually with structural problem, **BPH** or recent instrument
	- acute bacterial prostatitis: young, middle aged men, normal anatomy with **perineal discomfort** or bladder obstruction
- Dx:
	- Must perform **digital rectal exam**. Presence of **prostate** tenderness, edema, warmth indicates prostatitis.
	- UA shows bacteruria usually gm-, e.Coli, proteus.
- Rx:
	- UTI: short course cipro, bactrim
	- acute prostatitis: similar abx, 6 weeks

**chronic prostatitis**

- ddx: either chronic pelvic pain syndrome or chronic bacterial. CPPS more common.
- dx: UA shows **>20 leukocytes/hpf**.
- Urine culture results then differentiate patients as having either:
	- **Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome** (CP/CPPS) - urine culture results are **aseptic**
	- Chronic bacterial prostatitis â€“ urine culture results show bacteriuria (>10 fold increase after prostate massage)
- rx: The underlying cause of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) remains unclear.  As a result, there is much uncertainty about the ideal approach to treatment.  Most patients receive a combination of therapies including medications for prostate enlargement (eg, alpha blockers), antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and/or psychotherapy.

## After urologic procedures

This patient's history and physical examination findings indicate acute bacterial prostatitis, and the most appropriate treatment regimen is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Patient groups at high risk for acute bacterial prostatitis include those with diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, or cirrhosis. Risk factors include unprotected sexual intercourse, urogenital instrumentation (chronic indwelling bladder catheterization, intermittent bladder catheterization, prostate biopsy), urinary tract manipulation (prostate resection), urinary stasis (obstruction), and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The most common infectious cause for acute bacterial prostatitis is _Escherichia coli_ or other gram-negative bacilli. Diagnosis is typically established with urine Gram stain and culture in patients with a compatible history. The treatment of choice for acute bacterial prostatitis is a prolonged course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or ciprofloxacin. Data on treatment duration are sparse, but 6 weeks is reasonable and recommended by experts. Given the prolonged duration of antimicrobial therapy required in cases of acute bacterial prostatitis, it is most prudent to select an antibiotic with appropriate coverage, while also attempting to minimize the potential for serious adverse effects. Prolonged ciprofloxacin use has been associated with QT prolongation as well as tendinopathy/tendon rupture, especially in older adults. As such, given the treatment duration needed for acute bacterial prostatitis, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole would be the most appropriate choice.

Amoxicillin would be an appropriate choice for patients with acute prostatitis and gram-positive cocci in chains. This finding would suggest an enterococcal infection, and treatment with amoxicillin or ampicillin would be appropriate. Neither of these antibiotics would be effective for acute bacterial prostatitis caused by _E. coli_ or other gram-negative bacilli.

Men younger than 35 years who are sexually active and men older than 35 years who engage in high-risk sexual behavior should be treated with regimens that cover _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ and _Chlamydia trachomatis._ Ceftriaxone and doxycycline, or ceftriaxone and azithromycin, would be appropriate treatment choices in cases of acute epididymitis, specifically targeting _C. trachomatis_ or _N. gonorrhoeae._ Neither regimen would be appropriate in this case.

Cephalexin would be an appropriate choice for patients with acute prostatitis and gram-positive cocci in clusters suggesting infection with _Staphylococcus aureus_ or coagulase-negative staphylococci (_Staphylococcus epidermidis_ or _Staphylococcus saprophyticus_).
