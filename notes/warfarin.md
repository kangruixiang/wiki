<!-- warfarin reversal how -->

**Warfarin** is an anticoagulant commonly used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism.  Effects arise from the inhibition of vitamin K recycling, which reduces circulating levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X.  The major risk of therapy is bleeding-associated complications, particularly **intracranial hemorrhage**.

Patients on warfarin with intracranial hemorrhage require urgent **warfarin reversal** to prevent the propagation of hemorrhage; this is accomplished by administering the following:

- **Prothrombin complex concentrate**, which contains vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and normalizes INR <10 minutes after administration.
- **Intravenous vitamin K**, which results in sustained warfarin reversal but takes 12-24 hours for full effect.  Because of this delayed effect, vitamin K is always used with clotting factor replacement **(Choice D)**.

  Fresh frozen plasma is considered the second-line therapy for replacing vitamin K-dependent clotting factors due to the large volume (often >2 L) required and the delay for blood compatibility tests.  Fresh frozen plasma is typically used when prothrombin complex concentrate is unavailable.

  Intravenous idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody used to reverse the anticoagulant dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor.  This patient was on warfarin, not dabigatran; idarucizumab would be ineffective.
