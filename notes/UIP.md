Usual interstitial pneumonia is the pathologic manifestation of  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, but can also be seen as an end-stage  finding with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug toxicity, and  rarely sarcoidosis. It consists of primarily peripheral and basal reticular opacities with honeycombing.
