## M Fortuitum

<!-- M fortuitum is, when to suspect, dx -->

_M. fortuitum_ is one of the rapidly growing, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) capable of producing chronic, nonhealing wounds anywhere the bacteria has been introduced, including skin, soft tissue, surgical sites, and occasionally on prosthetic devices. Although _M. fortuitum_ is not part of the differential diagnosis of acute wound infections, NTM should always be considered in chronic wounds, especially when conventional antimicrobial therapy has been ineffective. To diagnose an NTM infection, a deep biopsy of chronic wound tissue should be performed. The biopsy specimen should be sent for histopathology to stain for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi, and a portion should be sent to the microbiology laboratory for similar stains and cultures.
