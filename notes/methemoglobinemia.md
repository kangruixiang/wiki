# Methemoglobinemia

<!-- methemoglobinemia cause, symptoms, treatment -->

| **Clinical presentation of methemoglobinemia** |                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **History**                                    | Exposure to oxidizing substances (eg, dapsone, nitrites, local/topical anesthetic) |
| **Clinical examination**                       | Cyanosis<br/>Pulse oximetry saturation 85%<br/>Dark chocolate-colored blood |
| **Laboratory findings**                        | Saturation gap (>5% difference between oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry & ABG)<br/>Normal PaO2 |
| **ABG** = arterial blood gas.                  |                                                              |

**Methemoglobinemia** is most commonly acquired after excessive **exposure to an oxidizing agent** (eg, dapsone, nitrites, local/topical anesthetics such as benzocaine/lidocaine).  Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin in which 1 of the 4 iron molecules is oxidized to the ferric (Fe3+) rather than the normal ferrous (Fe2+) state.  The ferric state has a decreased affinity for oxygen, but the remaining 3 ferrous heme sites have an increased oxygen affinity, which leads to **decreased oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues**.

Patients typically have **cyanosis** and **dark chocolate-colored blood**.  **Standard pulse oximetry readings** are **low** (85%) due to the absorption spectrum of methemoglobin and do not represent the true oxygen saturation.  Due to the poor oxygen affinity of methemoglobin, the administration of supplemental oxygen does not improve cyanosis, blood color, or pulse oximetry readings.  Because arterial blood gas testing analyzes unbound arterial oxygen (as opposed to hemoglobin-bound oxygen), the **PaO2 is normal** and overestimates the degree of true oxygen saturation.  With severe cases of methemoglobinemia, the decreased oxygen delivery can result in altered mental status, seizures, and death.

Treatment: Methylene blue acts as an electron acceptor for NADPH and is reduced to leucomethylene blue, which in turnÂ **reduces methemoglobin back to hemoglobin**.
