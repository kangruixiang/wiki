# Methemoglobinemia

<!-- methemoglobinemia cause, symptoms, dx, treatment -->

**Methemoglobinemia** is most commonly acquired after excessive **==exposure to an oxidizing agent==** (eg, dapsone, nitrites, local/topical anesthetics such as ==benzocaine/lidocaine (surgical patients)==).  Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin in which 1 of the 4 iron molecules is oxidized to the ferric (Fe3+) rather than the normal ferrous (Fe2+) state.  The ferric state has a decreased affinity for oxygen, but the remaining 3 ferrous heme sites have an increased oxygen affinity, which leads to **decreased oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues**.

Patients typically have **==cyanosis==** and **==dark chocolate-colored blood==**.  **Standard pulse oximetry readings** are **low** (85%) due to the absorption spectrum of methemoglobin and do not represent the true oxygen saturation.  Due to the poor oxygen affinity of methemoglobin, the ==administration of supplemental oxygen does not improve cyanosis==, blood color, or pulse oximetry readings.  Because ==arterial blood gas testing== analyzes unbound arterial oxygen (as opposed to hemoglobin-bound oxygen), the **==PaO2 is normal==** and overestimates the degree of true oxygen saturation.  With severe cases of methemoglobinemia, the decreased oxygen delivery can result in altered mental status, ==seizures==, and death.

Confirmation of the diagnosis requires a **==co-oximeter==**, which is a device that can accurately ==measure the presence of methemoglobin==.  The offending agent(s) should be discontinued in all patients with suspected methemoglobinemia, while symptomatic patients and those with a **methemoglobin level > 20%** require prompt administration of **methylene blue** (a reducing agent).  Those in shock may also require blood transfusion or an exchange transfusion.

Treatment: ==Methylene blue== acts as an electron acceptor for NADPH and is reduced to leucomethylene blue, which in turn **reduces methemoglobin back to hemoglobin**.
