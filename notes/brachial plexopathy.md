<!-- brachial plexopathy causes -->

This patient’s presentation is consistent with **brachial plexopathy**, which is most commonly associated with ==breast and apical lung cancer==. Brachial plexopathy can occur from ==direct cancer invasion== or from ==radiation injury==.  Patients typically develop ==gradual weakness== in the brachial plexus distribution; the above table summarizes the differences between cancer-induced and radiation-induced brachial plexopathy.

- Direct **cancer invasion** of the plexus nerves usually presents with more severe pain at symptom onset, involves the lower plexus, and is associated with Horner syndrome.
- Radiation injury presents with pain later in the symptom course, affects the upper plexus, and has more paresthesias and weakness.

Electromyography can also help distinguish between the 2 conditions (i.e., fasciculations and myokymia are more likely to be seen in radiation plexitis).  This patient’s **lower plexus pain** and **Horner syndrome** suggests cancer-induced rather than radiation-induced plexopathy.
