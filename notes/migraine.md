- related: [[Neurology]], [[Headache2]]

## Demographics

<!-- ignore -->

People that suffer migraines are often **10-30 years of age**; **females** are more commonly affected than males.

The pathophysiology of migraines is poorly understood, but it is **thought to be due to neuronal dysfunction**.

<!-- migraine headache triggers -->

Factors that can precipitate migraines include:

- **Stress**
- **Oral contraceptives**
- **Menstruation**
- **Exertion**
- **Foods containing tyramine or nitrates** (chocolate, cheese, processed meats)

## Symptoms

<!-- migraine sx, without aura vs with aura -->

**Migraine without aura** (a.k.a. common migraine) are severe headaches that are not preceded by an aura. Most cases of migraines do not involve an aura. Need to meet following criteria:

- duration **4-72 hours**
- at least 2 of following:
	- unilateral pain
	- pulsating pain, moderate or severe pain
	- aggravation or causing avoidance of physical activity
- at least one of following during headache:
	- nausea
	- vomiting
	- photophobia and phonophobia

**Migraine with aura** (a.k.a. classic migraine) are severe headaches preceded by a visual change such as bright or flashing lights, dark spots occluding areas of vision (**scotomas**), visual field changes, and even reversible focal neurological deficits such as hemiparesis lasting 5-30 min. Auras typically last for 10-20 minutes.

<!-- migraine headache in children sx -->

**Migraines in children are often bifrontal and shorter in duration.**

<!-- basilar migraines symptoms -->

Basilar migraines occur due to **cerebral vasospasm involving the brainstem**.  Patients typically have **basilar aura** symptoms (eg, vertigo, dysarthria, tinnitus, diplopia) **without motor weakness, followed by a migraine-type headache**.

<!-- migraine vs tension headache -->

- [[tension headache]] can also present similar like migraine but **does not cause nausea**, and have at least 2 of following:
	- bilateral
	- nonpulsating
	- mild to moderate
	- do not interfere with daily activities

## Imaging

<!-- imaging for migraines -->

- not warranted with sx and normal physical exam

- considered for following:
	- not classic headache
	- change in pattern
	- focal neurologic signs/sx
	- red flags:
		- onset after 50
		- persistent neurologic changes
		- systemic sx
		- immunosuppression
		- sudden onset
		- progressive pain
		- positional nature
		- headache precipitated by valsalva
		- papilledema

- Urgent secondary causes:
	- SAH, thunderclap onset
	- SDH: prior trauma, altered level of consciousness, neurologic deficits
	- meningitis: fever, confusion
	- HTN emergency: blurry vision
	- temporal arteritis
	- CVA
	- neoplasm: weight loss, age > 50, wakes from sleep, progressive
	- pseudotumor cerebri

## Treatment

<!-- migraine abortive treatment -->

Treatment is based on severity.

- Mild to moderate severity with infrequency (<8 per month), use abortive therapy:
	- NSAIDS, tylenol
	- **Ergotamine**, **dihydroergotamine**
	- triptans: avoid in HTN and CV disease
		- SQ sumitriptan 6mg NNT 2.3, much quicker, $500 / 6 syringes
		- Oral rizatriptan 10mg NNT 3
	- antiemetics: metoclopramide, domeperidone

<!--  migraine ppx when,  -->

- ppx considered when:
	- > 3 days/month headache, not responding to abortive
	- > 8 days/month headaches
	- significant interference with activity despite abortive therapy

- expect 30-50% decrease in sx after 3-4 weeks

- Beta blockers: propranolol, metoprolol, nadolol

- TCA: nortriptyline, amitriptyline

- anti-epilepticcs: topiramate, gabapentin, divalproex

- Botox injection

- Aimovig injections

- natural supplements shown to decrased frequency, duration, severity:
	- oral mag: 400-600 mg QD
	- Coenzyme Q10: 300mg QD
	- Butterbur: 50-150mg QD, hepatotoxicity
	- Oral riboflavin 400mg QD: decrease frequency but not severity or duration

- lifestyle modifications:
	- avoid dietary triggers (1 in 5 pts)
		- caffeine withdrawal
		- nitrites/nitrates in preserved meats
		- tyramines, xanthines, aged cheese, red wine, beer, chocolate, champagne
		- MSG
		- dairy
		- fatty food

Migraine prophylaxis includes the use of:

- **Tricyclic antidepressant** (e.g. amitriptyline)
- **Beta blockers** (e.g. metoprolol, propranolol, timolol)
- **Calcium channel blockers** (e.g. nifedipine, verapamil)
- **Anticonvulsants** (e.g. valproate, topiramate)

## Complications

<!-- ignore -->

- women with active migraine with aura has increased ischemic CV disease and stroke. People without aura do not have increased events.
- Men with migraine have higher risk for CV events
