# posterior urethral valve

<!-- posterior urethral valve cause, sx, dx, rx -->

- cause: congenital urethra obstruction by residual embryologic tissue during development in boys (most likely problem with wolffian duct insertion)
- sx: palpable bladder on exam, bilateral hydronephrosis, dilated/thickened bladder, oligohydramnios
- dx:
	- antenatal ultrasound showing hydro, thickened/dilated bladder, dilated proximal urethra
	- confirmed with **voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG)**. VCUG is performed by catheterizing the patient, injecting radiopaque dye, and obtaining images during voiding.  Infants with a PUV who undergo VCUG generally have dilated bladders, and approximately 25%-50% have some degree of vesicoureteral reflux and ureteral dilation due to the severe outflow obstruction caused by the PUV.  However, the diagnosis is confirmed by visualization of a **dilated proximal urethra** when the catheter is removed (the catheter keeps the valve open and must be removed before the end of imaging).
- rx: **Foley catheter** placed to temporarily relieve the obstruction.  When the infant's condition is stabilized, **cystoscopy** allows direct visualization and ablation of the valve, which is curative.
