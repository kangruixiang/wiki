- Malabsorption causes more intestinal fatty acid binding to calcium, which increases colonic oxalate absorption and renal oxalate excretion.

## Diabetes

Randomized controlled trials have shown that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is more effective than conventional medical therapy (eg, lifestyle changes, weight management counseling, oral hypoglycemics, insulin) in patients with ==uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and severe obesity== (BMI >35).  In one study, 42% of patients achieved a ==hemoglobin A1c <6.0% at 12 months== with combined medical therapy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, versus 12% of patients who received intensive medical therapy alone.  In another study, 75% of patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass alone achieved a hemoglobin A1c <7% at 12 months, versus 32% of patients who received intensive medical therapy alone.
