About 90%-95% of patients with a kidney transplant have hypertension  secondary to specific transplant-related factors or recipient  characteristics. This patient presents with severe hypertension and  normal baseline renal function (creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL), which is  unlikely to be seen in allograft rejection. This patient developed  acute kidney injury (creatinine increased to 2.4 mg/dL) after the  initiation of an ACE inhibitor. This is highly suggestive of underlying transplant renal artery stenosis as the cause of his hypertension.

Renal hypoperfusion due to renal artery stenosis stimulates the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that in turn causes hypertension  and maintains the glomerular capillary pressure and glomerular  filtration rate (GFR). In patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney (eg, patients with  transplant), administration of ACE inhibitors lowers the angiotensin II  level acutely, leading to a significant decrease in GFR (by >30%) and acute kidney injury. Renal artery stenosis should also be suspected in transplant recipients with resistant hypertension, flash pulmonary  edema, or progressive loss of renal function.

Transplant renal artery stenosis causes hypertension in 10%-12% of patients  usually within the first 2 years after kidney transplantation. Improper surgical anastomosis is an important cause. It can also occur in acute rejection and cytomegalovirus infection.
