# 06 Pituitary Anatomy

<!-- Germ layers of neural tube, stomatodeum, and digestive tube -->

- Neural tube: neuroectoderm
- Stomatodeum: ectoderm
- Digestive tube: endoderm

<!-- Anterior and posterior pituitary develop from where, when, which germ layer -->

During the **third week**, the infundibulum forms as a diverticulum from the **diencephalon (neuroectoderm from neural tube)** grows ventrally toward the stomodeum which is the primative oral cavity.

Simultaneously, an **ectodermal** placode appears in the roof of the stomodeum.  This becomes the hypophysial diverticulum or **Rathke’s pouch** (outgrowth of oral cavity).

Rathke’s pouch grows dorsally and looses its connection with the stomodeum. the stalk left from stomatodeum apoptosis
and no longer attached..

<!-- Rathke's pouch forms what and where? -->

Cells of the anterior wall of Rathke’s pouch increase rapidly and form the **pars distalis** of the adenohypophysis. Posterior wall doesn’t develop much and grows along infundibulum to develop into the **pars intermedia**

Small extension of this lobe, the **pas tuberalis** grows along the stalk of the infundibulum and eventually surrounds it..

<!-- Anterior and posterior pituitary germ layers -->

Anterior pituitary derived from **ectoderm**.

Posterior pituitary derived from **neuroectoderm**..

## Craniopharyngioma

<!-- Craniopharyngioma is and pathogenesis -->

**Benign tumor of pituitary gland**, Derived from remnants of **Rathke’s pouch**. Instead of apoptosis, the remnant proliferate, , form cyst, and calcified. White and shiny. If occupy too much space (headache), must be removed.

<!-- Craniopharyngioma cyst germ layer -->

**Surface ectoderm** in cyst because derived from Rathke's pouch..

<!-- Craniopharyngioma symptoms -->

Symptoms are from **compression of brain tissues**:

- Hypopituitarism
- Headache, visual field defects
- Behavioral change from frontal lobe dysfunction..

<!-- Craniopharyngioma age demographics -->

Bimodal distribution of occurrence:

- **5-14**
- **65-74**.

# Pituitary Anatomy

<!-- Pituitary location, bone -->

Pituitary sits in the sella turcica (turkish saddle) of the **sphenoid bone**..

## Anterior lobe

<!-- Anterior lobe of pituitary aka and why -->

Aka **adenohypophysis** because its is comprised of **hormone-producing glandular cells** (forms 80% of gland).

<!-- Anterior lobe consists of -->

Consists of:

- Pars tuberalis
- Pars intermedia
- Pars distalis.

## Posterior lobe

<!-- Posterior lobe of pituitary aka and why -->

Aka **neurohypophysis** because cells look like glial cells similar to cells of nervous system. Contains axons and nerve terminals from hypothalamus.

<!-- Posterior lobe consists of -->

Consists of:

- Median Eminence
- Infundibulum, aka pituitary stalk.

### Median Eminence

<!-- What's special about median eminence's structure? -->

- One of the circumventricular organs (CVOs)
- Does not contain BBB.
