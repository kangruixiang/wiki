# 01 Innate Immunity

<!-- Barriers to infection -->

# Innate vs adaptive

<!-- innate vs adaptive: speed, specificity, memory, 2nd infection -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/EPn02kg.jpg)

<!-- innate vs adaptive: antigen presentation -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/nszFPAD.jpg)

- Innate immune response can react directly to invaders
- T cells require antigen presentation from APC
- If T cells can react to any thing, then autoimmune problems

# Cytokines

<!-- What are cytokines, released by, results, types and function -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/O0YzL02.jpg)

- interleukins: travel between leukocytes

# CD

<!-- What are CDs? -->

# Innate

<!-- Different types of innate immune cells -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/Y7FjRGD.jpg)

- Neutrophils on call to assist macrophages when needed

<!-- How do innate immune system recognize foreign molecules in general. What type of receptor do they use. -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/vx5hr8z.jpg)

<!-- Different PAMPS that innate immune system recognizes -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/Udlyu9A.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/IuN7HuR.jpg)

- Virus have double stranded RNA and some single stranded RNA that transiently gets copied to double
- DNA in human is methylated; bacteria has unmethylated DNA

# Macrophages

<!-- Macrophage lifespan, made where as what, names in different tissues -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/kbU8STp.jpg)

- macrophages guards, ready to consume any foreigners

<!-- macrophages 3 functions -->

## Phagocytosis

<!-- macrophages phagocytosis how -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/cxNuTda.jpg)

<!-- macrophages how do they kill phagocytosed microbes -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/cDFRsUs.jpg)

- proteases break down proteins, nucleases nucleotides, lysozymes cell wall

![](https://i.imgur.com/pOks5Mq.jpg)

- tissue destruction from macrophages/neutrophils

<!-- pathogen example that breaks phagocytosis -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/8fOkMbD.jpg)

- TB modifies surface of phagosome

<!-- macrophages activated and resting states. Major activators -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/8unm9i9.jpg)

<!-- macrophages surface molecules and signals to those surface receptors -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZKAbBg4.jpg)

## Cytokines

<!-- Macrophages key cytokines -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/vns9hSj.jpg)

- macrophages 1st line of defense: IL-1

<!-- IL-1, TNF-a functions, common function -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/GzXRKDw.jpg)

- macrophages 1st line of defense: 1st IL
- IL1 raises set point temperature
- TNF-a kills tumors by causing coagulation in tumors, but can also cause DIC

<!-- IL-6, 8, 12 functions -->

# Neutrophils

<!-- neutrophils made location, stain color, life span, function -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/aKyz9eX.jpg)

- backup cells to macrophages

<!-- Neutrophil transmigration how. When and how are the molecules stimulated -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/7b9QeLR.jpg)

- SL X: carbohydrate

![](https://i.imgur.com/KOwZtj8.jpg)

- Neutrophils always have SL X, normally nothing to bind to

![](https://i.imgur.com/dNRtQuN.jpg)

- ICAM always on endothelial cells, normally can't bind anything

<!-- neutrophil 2 types of enzymes -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/iAAVH2e.jpg)

- alk phos: low in some leukemias (CML)
- collagenase: breaks down collagen; lysozyme: breaks down cell wall; lactoferrin: found in breast milk and binds iron, lyse bacteria and kill cell in neutrophils

![](https://i.imgur.com/prsWx5J.jpg)

<!-- Neutrophil antigen presentation? Opsonins -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/wxZuXUy.jpg)

- LTB4

# Complement

<!-- complement produced where, binds what -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/WPgDWbZ.jpg)

- alternative pathway: spontaneous conversion

![](https://i.imgur.com/1tC6phV.jpg)

# NK cells

<!-- NK cells functions -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/Y5haRzR.jpg)

<!-- NK cell kill infected cells how -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/fsCoqHB.jpg)

<!-- NK cells surface molecules, function, CD, CD aka -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/UrSXZ5p.jpg)

## ADCC

<!-- ADCC process. 2 types -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/iyF86wX.jpg)

- antibodies elements of adaptive immune system

![](https://i.imgur.com/S7PyC9Y.jpg)

<!-- NK cells antigen presentation? Memory, maturation, lineage -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/McDfsYv.jpg)

- NK part of innate; T/B part of adaptive

# Eosinophils

<!-- Granulocytes examples, function -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/0ZI3vN1.jpg)

<!-- eosinophil stain color, enzymes -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZABawt2.jpg)

- positive charge picks up Eosin dye

<!-- eosinophil activation how, when are cell count increased -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/mI2FE75.jpg)

# Basophils

<!-- mast cells and basophils stain color, activated how, enzymes -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/tPu68PB.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/yF0fiwB.jpg)

- helminths binds multiple IgE, triggering cross link and degranulation

# Dendritic Cells

<!-- dendritic cells are, aka, location, function -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/ADsu9EF.jpg)

- star shaped
- professional antigen presenters
- battle raging in tissue; dendritic cells pick up antigen to present to T cells
