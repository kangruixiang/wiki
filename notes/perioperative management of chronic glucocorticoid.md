<!-- perioperative management of chronic glucocorticoid therapy. Different risk groups -->

Suppression of adrenal function is likely to develop in patients receiving corticosteroids for a prolonged period.  This is especially true for those who receive **high doses** and those who are **dosed at night** rather than during the morning hours.  In addition, patients with a **Cushingoid appearance** are more likely to have a suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.  Patients treated with corticosteroids for <3 weeks are less likely to develop HPA suppression.  More importantly, normal HPA axis function after corticosteroid use may not fully recover for up to **6-12 months** after discontinuation of the medication.  During the recovery period, a patient may be asymptomatic under normal conditions but can develop adrenal crisis during stressful situations such as severe illness or surgery.

An ==ACTH (cosyntropin) stimulation test== is performed to determine whether stress-dose corticosteroids are necessary in patients at ==intermediate risk for HPA axis suppression==.  If the patient has a subnormal increase in cortisol level following ACTH stimulation, stress-dose corticosteroids must be given perioperatively.

A typical perioperative corticosteroid regimen for a major surgical procedure is hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously during surgery followed by 50 mg every 8 hours for 24 hours with a rapid taper (generally 1-2 days) as the stress resolves.
