- HPV related
- oropharynx
- surgery and radiation can cure head and neck cancer. Chemothrerapy can't
- Don't delay curative radiation by doing induction chemotherapy
- Adding chemotherapy to radiation improves chance of curing and mortality
- surgery if chemoradiation fails
- HPV+ improves overall survival and progression free survival

- Cisplatin: best and also substantial SE

- Carboplatin: developed to reduce nausea/vomiting, ototoxicity, AKI. SE includes myelosuppression, higher risk of neutropenic fever, hypersensitivity reaction (risk accumulates especially after 8 doses)

- Cetuximab: targets regular EGFR that's more frequent in head and neck cancer. Can be used because do not need good kidney function
