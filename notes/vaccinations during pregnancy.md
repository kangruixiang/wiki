The incidence of pertussis in the United States has increased due to waning immunity.  Pertussis in infants age <3 months, who are at highest risk of acquiring the infection from affected adults, is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality.  Therefore, **==Tdap vaccination==** (tetanus toxoid-reduced diphtheria toxoid-acellular pertussis) is recommended for women **during each pregnancy**, regardless of previous vaccination history.  The Tdap vaccine is safe during every trimester; however, vaccination during the **third trimester** is preferred as it both facilitates the maternal antibody response and provides passive immunity to the neonate.  Tdap vaccination is also recommended for family members who have not been recently vaccinated and will be in close contact with the newborn.
