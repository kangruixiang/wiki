This patient most likely has **Ehlers-Danlos syndrome** (EDS), a connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility, recurrent joint dislocations, hyperextensible skin with easy bruisability, and delayed healing with atrophic scars. Patients may have associated skeletal abnormalities, including thoracolumbar **scoliosis**, pectus excavatum, and pes planus. Other features include hernias, cervical insufficiency, and uterine prolapse. **Mitral valve prolapse** with myxomatous degeneration of the valvular apparatus is a  complication of EDS and can lead to rupture of the chordae tendineae and acute mitral valve regurgitation (MR).

Marfan syndrome shares many  features with EDS. Both diseases can cause scoliosis as well as  myxomatous mitral valve degeneration and chordae tendineae rupture,  leading to acute MR. However, skin findings are much less prominent in  Marfan syndrome; this patient's velvety skin with atrophic scarring is  consistent with EDS.

MRI/MRA of the brain can identify berry aneurysms, which occur more  commonly in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, in contrast to aortic aneurysms in  MFS. Joint hypermobility and skin hyperextensibility are characteristic of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

The main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with MFS is **aortic root disease**, manifesting as aneurysmal dilation, aortic regurgitation, and/or dissection. Patients with suspected MFS require an **echocardiogram** prior to sports participation. If aortic root disease and/or a family  history of aortic dissection or sudden death is present, patients are  counseled to **avoid strenuous physical activity**, with intense/contact sports (eg, track, basketball, football) generally restricted.
