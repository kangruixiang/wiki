# prolactinoma

<!-- prolactinoma management -->

Male patients with atrophic testes, decreased sexual performance, and an elevated serum prolactin level have a **prolactinoma** until proven otherwise. **Brain MRI** in this patient is likely to reveal a mass in the pituitary gland. His **visual field deficit** is further suggestive of a pituitary mass, as bitemporal hemianopsia  can result from compression of the optic chiasm. A prolactinoma is a  benign neoplasm of the lactotroph cells in the pituitary gland. In men, the **hyperprolactinemia** induced by this tumor results in a **decreased serum testosterone** concentration, which can cause decreased libido, muscle mass, body hair, and testicular size.

Patients with a prolactinoma need to be treated if they meet either of the  following criteria: presence of neurologic symptoms secondary to the  size of the mass, or hypogonadism or other symptoms secondary to  hyperprolactinemia. Initial treatment should consist of a **dopamine agonist** such as cabergoline or bromocriptine; in >90% of patients,  pharmacologic management decreases prolactin secretion and reduces the  size of the mass. **Surgery** should be reserved for patients who do not respond to dopamine agonist therapy.
