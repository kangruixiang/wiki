title: Pediatric Nephrology

## category: peds

# Overview

<!-- pediatric kidney disease locations.. -->

Kidney:

- malignancy
- Hematuria (glomerular)

Ureter:

- ureteropelvic junction obxtruction
- ureterovesicular junction obstruction
- ectopic ureter
- vesiculoretero reflux

Bladder:

- Hematuria (nonglomerular)

Urethra:

- posterior urethral valves
- hypo/epispadius

## Hematuria

## Labs

<!-- labs used for pediatric nephrology.. -->

US: Use for hydro or not to see obstruction/reflux

Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG): catheter + dye, if in ureter = reflex

CT scan:

- trauma: use contrast
- stones: noncontrast

cystoscopy: camera to see where blood is. Intraluminal lesions (bladder hematuria, cancers)

Intravenous pyelogram, IVP: never use

Renal biopsy: almost never use

# Urethra Diseases

## Posterior Urethra Valves

<!-- posterior urethral valves patho, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

Pathogenesis

- Redundant tissues cause obstruction like BPH. Babies can't get urine out from day 1. Bladder gets bigger, urine goes back to ureter

Symptoms

- Oligohydramnios in prenatal care from no urine. Diagnosed from hydro on US
- **No urine output and distended bladder**
- Creatinine maybe normal or high with maternal clearance

Diagnosis

- US: hydro
- VCUG: rule out reflux
- Catheter: massive urine output

Treatment

- Catheter for temporary relief
- Surgery for permanent fix

## Hypo/Epi-spadius

<!-- hypo/epi-spadius patho, symptoms, treatment avoid.. -->

Pathogenesis

- Penis created from zipping up top and bottom of vagina and pull out, with urethra in middle. If one zipper moves too fast, urethra end up at different place:
	- Epi: on top, dorsal, pee on face
	- Hypo: bottom, ventral

Symptoms

- Not much of a problem at first because on diapers anyway. Fix with surgery

Treatment

- Never to circumcision, need extra tissue foreskin to rebuild urethra

# Ureters

## Ureteropelvic junction obstruction

<!-- ureteropelvic junction obstruction and ureterovesicular obstruction patho, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

Pathogenesis

- narrow lumen
- normal urine flow at most of life
- increased flow: simulate obstruction

Symptoms

- Normal teenager at first alcohol binge, taking large volume and large diuresis from alcohol
- Colicky abd pain that spontaneously resolves

Diagnosis

- Ultrasound:
	- Ureteropelvic: obstruction at pelvis, big kidney, no hydroureter
	- Ureterovesicular: obstruction at bladder, hydronephrosis and hydroureter
- VCUG: rule out reflux

Treatment

- Stent
- Surgery

## Ectopic Ureter

<!-- ectopic ureter patho and symptoms, difference in gender, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

Pathogenesis and Symptoms

- One normal ureter to bladder
- One that implants anywhere
	- Boys: Always implant above external sphincter, asymptomatic
	- Girls: Normal urinary function + constant leaking from planting below vagina/sphincter, never dry
	- Similar to fistula symptoms but in very young population

Diagnosis

- US: no hydro
- VCUG: no reflux
- Radionucleotide scan: assess renal function

Treatment

- Rurgery: re implant

## Vesiculouretero Reflux

<!-- vesiculouretero reflux patho, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

Pathogenesis

- retrograde flow

Symptoms

- Recurrent UTI
- Pyelonephritis (usually don't happen in kids unless congenital defect)

Diagnosis

- Prenatal US: hydro
- US: hydro
- VCUG: reflux

Treatment

- moderate: suppressive antiobiotics, kids may grow out of it
- Surgery
