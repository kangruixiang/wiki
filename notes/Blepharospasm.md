# Blepharospasm

<!-- blepharospasm is, sx, rx -->

The clinical scenario described is suggestive of blepharospasm, which is a form of focal dystonia.  The history of periodic involuntary eye closure that can be provoked by external stimuli (eg, bright light or irritants) is typical.  Older women are particularly predisposed to this condition.  A potential explanation is that dry eyes in postmenopausal women may serve as a trigger for blepharospasm.  Botulinum toxin injections are the mainstay of treatment.  They can be used for many years without any loss of efficacy or significant side effects.
