# 04 Complement

<!-- complement system important for -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/hMPb5Fw.jpg)

- great for encapsulated bacteria

# C3

<!-- complement overview steps -->

- Overview of complement
- 3 different pathways, next step always MAC

# Alternative Pathway

<!-- alternative pathway process, binds what -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/J9udcKr.jpg)

- destroyed in less than a second if not bound

## C3b

<!-- C3b function -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/R90VgTw.jpg)

- stable c3b creates more of itself via positive loop

## Factor H

<!-- factor H is, function, pathogens that use it -->

# Lectin Pathway

<!-- lectin pathway process, main molecule and associated with what other protein -->

# Classical pathway

<!-- classic pathway, process -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/HlL6nPM.jpg)

- Alternative and MBL part of innate immunity

## C1

<!-- C1 components and function. How does it activate classic pathway. Which immune molecule does it bind the best -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/84ngVc6.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/rYGJDH4.jpg)

- IgM: 2 Fc very close together, easy C1 binding
- IgG: ok complement activation

## CRP

<!-- CRP is, activation, function. Does not do what -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/yH0TnzZ.jpg)

- binds C polysaccharides of bacteria

# C3a C3b

<!-- C3 components, function of each component -->

# MAC

<!-- MAC formed from, function, aka -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/UCR7fDI.jpg)

- aka late complement

## C5a

<!-- C5 components and function of each -->

# Inhibition

<!-- Self cells inhibit complement by, which cell most important, what happens when deficient -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/7EV95sM.jpg)

## PNH

<!-- PNH is, pathogenesis, classic symptoms -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/TXT68QS.jpg)

- DAF/CD59 deficiency
- start at RBC lysis
- Free plasma Hgb thrombogenic
- Priapism: sustained prolonged erection

![](https://i.imgur.com/gjkjOfk.jpg)

## C3 Deficiency

<!-- C3 deficiency symptoms -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/HwBb8VS.jpg)

- immune complex: antigen-antibody, usually cleared via complement binding and macrophage

## C5-9 deficiency

<!-- C5-9 deficiency symptoms -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/SKvuFaE.jpg)

- not as bad as c3 deficient

## Hereditary Angioedema

<!-- hereditary angioedema pathogenesis, demographics, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/rWqcYeu.jpg)

- c1 inhibitor breaks down bradykinin

![](https://i.imgur.com/Pngey8b.jpg)

- urticaria: histamine, not here
- Epinephrine doesn't work

<!-- Hereditary angioedema CI -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/Xh9D84H.jpg)

- ace inhibitor block bradykinin breakdown

  ## C3 Nephritic

<!-- C3 nephritic factor function, result -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/YOeljGv.jpg)

## Hypocomplementemia

<!-- CH50, C3/C4 measurement for -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/NEKcwJM.jpg)

- CH50: classic pathway lysis sheep RBC. Qualitative test, yes or no
