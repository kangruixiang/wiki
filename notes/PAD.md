- manage risks: e.g. smoking cessation
- initial management: **supervised exercise program** best for **claudication**
	- 30-45 minutes of supervised walking >3 times a week for >3 months
	- Once the walking time required to  develop claudication is determined, the sessions are gradually increased until the patient can walk for a longer period without developing  symptoms.
	- Patients may experience **moderate increases in symptom-free walking distance**.
- Pharm: antiplatelet and statin
- twice daily cilostazol can help with symptoms
- revascularization via stent or bypass reserved for **critical limb ischemia**

## Limb Ischemia

- **acute limb ischemia (ALI)**
- pathogenesis: sudden decrease in limb perfusion, often caused by acute arterial occlusion due to systemic embolism from a  cardiac source (eg, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular thrombus, or  septic emboli from infective endocarditis).
- sx: **six P's** of acute ischemia: **pain, pallor, paresthesia, pulselessness, poikilothermia**, and **paralysis**.
	- severe resting pain with sensory/motor loss
	- delayed capillary refill
	- no doppler signals
- imaging: CT angiography, duplex US, MRA for patients with viable ALI
- rx:
	- **anticoagulation**, IV heparin bolus with infusion
	- emergent surgical revascularization or catheter based thrombolytics
