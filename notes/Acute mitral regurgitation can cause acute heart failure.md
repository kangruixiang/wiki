This patient has acute heart failure due to **acute mitral valve regurgitation** (MR). Acute MR can occur due to papillary muscle rupture, typically in the setting of myocardial infarction (MI), or due to rupture of the  mitral chordae tendineae. Patients with **mitral valve prolapse**, especially when it is related to underlying **connective tissue disease** (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), are at risk for mitral  chordae tendineae rupture, leading to a flail leaflet and acute MR.  Patients with acute MR typically have a dramatic presentation (due to  lack of time for left heart adaptation) compared to those with chronic  MR. They often present with sudden-onset   progress to cardiogenic shock with poor tissue perfusion and peripheral  vasoconstriction. Cardiac examination reveals a **hyperdynamic precordium** and a decrescendo holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex. Patients  with acute, severe MR have early equalization of left atrial and left  ventricular pressures, and up to 50% (especially with
