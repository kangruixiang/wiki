# acute liver failure

- related: [[GI]], [[acute fatty liver of pregnancy]]

The 3 criteria for acute liver failure are evidence of hepatic injury  (eg, elevated aminotransferases), encephalopathy, and INR â‰¥1.5; this  patient has only 1 of these 3 criteria. Given the very low risk of  progression to acute (fulminant) liver failure due to acute HBV  infection (<1%), admission to the intensive care unit is not  warranted.
