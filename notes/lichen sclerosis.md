<!-- lichen sclerosis pt, cause, sx, rx, complications -->

- Pt: postmenopausal women
- cause: autoimmune, atrophy etiology. Benign lesion characterized by a **thinning of the epidermis and fibrosis (sclerosis) of the underlying dermis.**
- sx:
	- early stage: **hypopigmented** areas, increase sensitivity = intense itching with erosions/excoriations
	- chronic stage: scratching/irritation causes thickened skin (lichenification) and vulvar plaque
	- severe stage: structural changes, loss of labia minoria, clitoral hood = obstruct urethra causing dysuria, incomplete voiding, nocturia
	- The lesions of lichen sclerosis commonly present as a **white patch (leukoplakia) with “parchment-like” vulvar skin (like paper).**
- dx: Punch biopsy of adult-onset lesions to exclude malignancy
- rx: high potency topical steroids
- complications: Lichen Sclerosis is associated with a slightly **increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma**.
