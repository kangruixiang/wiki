<!-- Cushing syndrome therapy following adrenalectomy -->

- Cushing syndrome: suppressed ACTH production due to excess cortisol secretion from adrenal gland
- following surgery: impaired endogenous cortisol production. Chronic atrophy from lack of ACTH stimulation
- Give hydrocortisol following surgery and then taper
- fludrocortisone not required
	- aldosterone secretion from contralateral adrenal gland not impacted
	- fludrocortisone required if bilateral adrenalectomy
