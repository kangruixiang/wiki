# 01 Bone Disorders

<!-- Osteoporosis definition and pathognesis -->

Is a _quantitative_ disorder of bone, meaning there is a reduction in bone mass despite the bone being sufficiently mineralized..

- too much osteoclast, not enough osteoblast

<!-- Osteoporosis affects which bone -->

Primarily affects trabecular bone, resulting in **decreased bone mass and density with fewer trabecular interconnections**. Osteoclast and blast acts on bone surfaces. Trabecular bones have the most amount of surface areas..

<!-- Two types of osteoporosis, names, demographics, type of fracture -->

**Type I** (**postmenopausal**) occurs in women 50-70 years old and presents primarily with _fractures of the distal radius_ (**Colles’ fracture**) _and vertebral bodies_.

**Type II** (**senile**) occurs in patients over 70 years old and presents with _fractures of the hip and pelvis_.  This type of osteoporosis does not show the same female predilection as type I osteoporosis..

<!-- Risk factors for osteoporosis overall, unmodifiable, modifiable -->

Risk factors include anything which contributes to an **imbalance in bone production and bone resorption**, resulting in diminishing bone mass.

Unmodifiable risk factors of osteoporosis include:

- **Caucasian ethnicity**
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**
- **Advancing age**
- **Postmenopausal status**
- **Previous fragility fracture**
- **Genetics**, including parental history of osteoporotic hip fracture

Modifiable risk factors of osteoporosis include:

- **History of heavy/protracted glucocorticoid use**
- **Low body weight**
- **Current cigarette smoking**
- **Excessive alcohol consumption**
- **Poor diet/exercise**..

<!-- Osteoporosis symptoms, location -->

There are _no clinical manifestations_ of osteoporosis **until the patient suffers a fracture**. Achy pain, in the absence of a fracture, is unlikely to be osteoporosis.

The incidence of fracture types related to osteoporosis is as follows (in order of decreasing frequency):

1. **Vertebral body**
2. **Hip (femoral neck)**
3. **Distal radius**

Vertebral body compression:

Accumulation of vertebral body fractures can cause **progressive kyphosis of the thoracic spine** (**Dowager’s hump**), respiratory compromise, restrictive lung disease, and an increased risk of pneumonia..

<!-- Osteoporosis screening -->

Patients over the age of 65 may have insurance coverage for **DEXA scans for osteoporosis screening**..

<!-- Fragility fractures is, vs pathologic fractures -->

**Fragility fractures** occur with minimal impact from _falls from a standing height or less_, such as a _Colles' fracture_ of the distal radius or a _vertebral body fracture_.  _NOTE_: It may sometimes be important to distinguish a true **fragility fracture** from a **pathological fracture**.  The latter is associated with osteolytic malignancy and presents as pain preceding a fracture that occurs with minimal trauma (e.g. picking up a grocery bag) and is _not associated with a fall from a standing height or less_.

Risk for future fragility fracture is much greater in patients with a **history of existing fragility fracture**..

<!-- osteoporosis labs -->

While not indicated strictly for the evaluation of osteoporosis, labs reveal **normal serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone (PTH)**..

<!-- Osteoporosis diagnosis -->

The diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made clinically in a **patient presenting with a fragility fracture** and otherwise clinically consistent picture (postmenopausal female, over 70 years old, no evidence of malignancy, etc.), or based on a **dual X-ray absorptiometry** (**DXA**) scan measurement of bone mineral density showing a **T-score more than 2.5 standard deviations below the mean**..

<!-- osteoporosis risk predication -->

Measurement of femoral neck bone mineral density is used to estimate risk of hip fracture and any major osteoporosis-related fracture (wrist, hip or vertebral body) in untreated patients with the **fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX)**.  This uses clinical data, risk factors, and the patient’s bone mineral density as measured at the _femoral neck_ to calculate the risk for a fragility fracture within the next ten years..

<!-- type 1 osteoporosis treatment -->

Since estrogen has a protective effect on bone, **hormone replacement therapy** is a treatment option for women with type I (postmenopausal) osteoporosis. (Note that estrogen is not a first-line therapy due to an increased risk of stroke and thromboembolism)..

<!-- Osteoporosis treatment -->

- 1st line: Bisphosphonate
- Hormone replacement for type 1
- SERMs
- Denosumab
- Teriparatide
- Weight bearing exercise
- Ca, Vit D supplementation
- stop smoking

**Regular weight-bearing exercise** helps to maximizing peak bone mass, which is key in the prevention of osteoporosis.

**Calcium** and **vitamin D supplementation** is recommended for all ages.

**Smoking accelerates bone loss**; cessation is encouraged for the prevention of osteoporosis..

# Paget

<!-- Paget disease aka -->

Aka osteitis deformans.

<!-- Paget cause, inheritance -->

Is characterized by massive bone turnover caused by increased and unbalanced osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity. The increased activity leads to the formation of abnormal bone architecture.

Believed to be caused by **both genetic and environmental factors**. Inheritance appears to be **autosomal dominant** with variable penetrance. There is some evidence linking Paget disease of bone to a slowly **progressive viral infection from a member of the paramyxovirus family**, such as the measles or respiratory syncytial virus, although this theory is controversial.

Paget's disease, on electron microscopy the nuclei of the osteoclasts contain particles that resemble paramyxovirus in their shape and orientation..

<!-- Paget pathogenesis phases -->

The pathogenesis of Paget disease of bone involves 4 phases:

1. **Lytic phase**
2. **Mixed phase**
3. **Sclerotic phase**
4. **Quiescent phase**..

## Lytic phase

<!-- Lytic phase of paget characteristics and result -->

Is characterized by **increased osteoclast activity** and **normal osteoblast activity**. This results in massive bone turnover that leads to poorly organized woven bone.

The initiating lesion in Paget disease of bone is caused by an **excessive increase in osteoclast activity**. This activity lead to **shaggy lytic bone lesions**.

Paget's disease, an osteoclast in pagetic bone contains many more nuclei than a usual osteoclast. A few of the nuclei contain eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion-like particles

Paget's disease, section of bone shows prominent and irregular basophilic cement lines and numerous lining osteoclasts and osteoblasts

## Mixed phase

<!-- Mixed phase of paget characteristics and result -->

Osteoclastic activity decreases while the **activity of osteoblasts greatly increases and predominates** during this phase.  

The initial lytic insult in osteitis deformans is followed by a **robust osteoblastic response**, which results in **increased alkaline phosphatase levels** in the serum.  

Excessive activity of osteoblasts leads to increased production of disorganized woven bone, also known as “mosaic bone,” which is weak, thick, and highly vascular with **ragged lytic areas of radiolucency** throughout the bone matrix.

## Sclerotic phase

<!-- Sclerotic phase of paget characteristics and result -->

**Osteoclastic activity declines** to negligible levels, while the activity of **osteoblasts remains elevated**.

Woven bone is replaced by focal pockets of abnormal, highly cellular lamellar bone with irregular “cement lines.”

The decreased levels of osteoclastic activity leads to absent/minimal bone turnover, and results in the production of sclerotic bone that is characterized by:

- **Enlarged/widened bones**
- **Absent Haversian systems**
- **Marrow spaces replaced by vascular fibrous tissue**.

## Quiescent phase

<!-- Quiescent phase of paget characteristics and result -->

Characterized by **minimal osteoclast and osteoblast activity**.  

## Symptoms

<!-- Paget Symptoms -->

Skull involvement that presents as:

- **Headaches**
- **Increased hat size**
- **Hearing loss** if it involves the bone surrounding the inner ear and/or narrows the auditory foramen
- **Loss of vision** and other **cranial nerve lesions** may also occur (however it is uncommon)

Commonly, there is involvement of weight bearing bones that manifests in **bone pain, long bone “chalk-stick fractures,”** and **large joint osteoarthritis**..

<!-- Paget X ray -->

X-ray imaging reveals **thickened bone cortex** with **shaggy radiolucent lytic lesions** interspersed throughout the bone matrix. Bone with these features are described as having a _cotton wool_ appearance.

“Chalk-stick fractures” are fractures, typically of long bones, in which the fracture is transverse to the long axis of the bone, like a broken stick of chalk. Commonly seen in Paget’s disease of bone and osteopetrosis.

<!-- Paget risk and associations -->

Patients with Paget disease of bone are at increased risk of developing **osteogenic sarcoma** (osteosarcoma).

Pagetoid bone is highly vascular with **extensive arteriovenous shunting** that may significantly increase blood flow, leading to **increased cardiac output.** This results in compensatory **left ventricular hypertrophy** and eventually, in severe cases of Paget disease of bone, **high-output heart failure**..

<!-- Paget hormone labs -->

Serum chemistry levels reflect the increased bone turnover present in Paget disease and show:

- **Normal calcium levels**
- **Normal phosphate levels**
- **Normal parathyroid hormone levels**
- **Increased alkaline phosphatase levels**..

<!-- Paget treatment -->

The treatments for Paget’s disease of bone include:

- **Bisphosphonates** (eg, alendronate, pamidronate, etidronate) are **first-line agents**
- Calcitonin is the drug of choice if there is extensive disease in weight-bearing bones..
