This patient is experiencing her second episode of **flash pulmonary edema** associated with **severe hypertension**.  She has peripheral arterial disease (intermittent claudication) and multiple risk factors (smoking, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) for diffuse **atherosclerosis**.  Recurrent flash pulmonary edema in patients with atherosclerotic disease should raise suspicion for **renovascular hypertension** due to **bilateral renal artery stenosis**.

Patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis can experience flash pulmonary edema (**Pickering syndrome**) despite normal left ventricular ejection fraction.  Other clues for renovascular hypertension include an acute rise in serum creatinine (>30%) after initiation of an ACE inhibitor or unexplained renal asymmetry on imaging studies.  Patients who have a high likelihood of renovascular disease should be evaluated with **renal Doppler ultrasound** or **CT** or **MR angiography** to detect renal artery stenosis.
