## Prosthetic Joint Infection

<!-- prosthetic joint infection organisms -->

| **Prosthetic joint infection**  |                                          |                                          |                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|                                 | **Early onset**                          | **Delayed onset**                        | **Late onset**                           |
| **Time to onset after surgery** | <3 months                                | 3-12 months                              | >12 months                               |
| **Presentation**                | Acute pain. Wound infection or breakdown. Fever | Chronic joint pain. Implant loosening. Sinus tract formation | Acute symptoms in previously asymptomatic joint. Recent infection at distant site |
| **Most common organisms**       | _Staphylococcus aureus_. Gram-negative rods. Anaerobes | Coagulase-negative staphylococci. _Propionibacterium_ species. Enterococci | _Staphylococcus aureus_. Gram-negative rods. Beta-hemolytic streptococci |

- early onset: < 3 months, staph aureus
- delayed onset: 3-12 months, CoNS, S. epidermidis
- late onset: > 12 months: staph aureus

PJI can be acquired by **perioperative contamination** of the joint or by extension from an overlying wound infection:

- Infections due to **virulent organisms** (eg, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_) typically present within the **first 3 months** after surgery (early onset infection) with acute pain, fever, leukocytosis, and overt local signs of infection (eg, erythema, purulent drainage), not seen in this patient.
- Infections due to less virulent organisms (eg, **coagulase-negative staphylococci**, _Propionibacterium_ species), as in this patient, are likely to have a **delayed onset** (3-12 months) and present with chronic pain, implant loosening, gait impairment, or sinus tract formation.  Fever and leukocytosis are usually absent.  **Staphylococcus epidermidis** is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus commonly implicated in delayed-onset PJI.
- Late-onset infections presenting >12 months after surgery are unlikely to have been acquired perioperatively and are usually due to hematogenous spread of a distant infection (eg, urinary tract infection).

<!-- prosthetic joint infection sx -->

- prolonged, low grade onset
- minimal swelling
- can present acutely

<!-- prosthetic joint infection dx -->

- xray: prosthesis loosening, periosteal reaction

<!-- prosthetic joint infection treatment -->

- removal of prosthesis
- IV a bx 6-8 weeks

This patient has subacute pain in his prosthetic knee 6 months after arthroplasty.  The synovial fluid analysis shows a mildly elevated leukocyte count with a predominance of neutrophils.  This is consistent with an inflammatory process, most likely a **prosthetic joint infection** (PJI).  The leukocyte count in the synovial fluid in PJI is usually elevated to >1000/mm3 but is often lower than in septic native joints (usually >50,000/mm3).
