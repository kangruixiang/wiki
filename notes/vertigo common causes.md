## BPPV

- Path: otolith
- symptoms: recurrent, reproducable vertigo lasting < 1 min
- diagnosis: Dix-Hallpike, look for rotary nyastagmus
- treatment: Epley

## Vestibular Neuritis or labyrinthritis (+hearing loss)

- path: viral (herpes)
- symptoms:
	- 4 weeks after URI
	- **single episode**
	- **vertigo can last for days**
	- maybe unilateral hearing loss (labyrinthritis)
	- maybe NV
- diagnosis:
	- positive **head-thrust test**: In this test, the patient focuses on the examiner's nose while the examiner quickly rotates the patient's head 10-15 degrees to the side; normally, the eyes remain fixed on the target, but in a patient with a peripheral vestibular disorder, the eyes initially rotate with the head before voluntarily redirecting back to the target (corrective saccade).
- treatment: steroids, anti-vertigo (meclizine), acyclovir for herpes

## Meniere

- path: unknown
- symptoms:
	- hearing loss, **tinnitus**, vertigo; >30 min, < 1hr.
	- **Chronic, episodic recurrent** vertigo
- diagnosis: clinical
- treatment: salt restriction, thiazide, anti-vertigo
