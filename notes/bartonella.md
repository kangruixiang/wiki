<!-- cat scratch sx, rx -->

This patient has cervical and preauricular  adenopathy as well as unilateral conjunctivitis. Given the history of  kitten exposure, she most likely has **oculoglandular syndrome** (Parinaud syndrome), a specific manifestation of **cat-scratch disease** (CSD). CSD is caused by infection due to _Bartonella henselae_, a small gram-negative rod carried by cats, especially kittens. Human  transmission most commonly occurs through a cat bite or scratch,  although many patients do no remember the exact point of contact.

CSD typically presents with **lymphadenitis** and is the most common cause of chronic (>2 weeks), unilateral  adenitis in children. Since bites and scratches usually occur on the  extremities, ipsilateral axillary or inguinal node involvement is most  common. However, when the inoculation is near the face, adenopathy of  the preauricular or cervical nodes is seen. Involvement of the  conjunctivae (as in this case) is an uncommon but characteristic  presentation of CSD.

Symptoms typically self-resolve within a couple of months; however, in some cases, lymph nodes will **suppurate** and drain onto the skin. Treatment with azithromycin can help  accelerate recovery, and needle aspiration may prevent overt rupture and relieve symptoms; lymph node excision is not indicated.
