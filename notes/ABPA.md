- patients: underlying asthma, CF
- pathogenesis: sensitization to aspergillus, intense IgE and IgG mediated immune response
- sx: **recurrent exacerbations**
- dx:
	- **elevated _Aspergillus_-specific IgE**
	- elevated (eg, >417 IU/mL) total IgE
	- positive _Aspergillus_-specific IgG
	- eosinophilia
	- **positive skin test** reactivity for _Aspergillus_.
	- Consequently, the initial evaluation for ABPA should include either skin testing for _Aspergillus_ or analysis of total and specific IgE concentrations.
- cxr: **upper lobe opacities**, atelectasis due to mucus plugging, and signs of **bronchiectasis** such as bronchial wall thickening.
- rx: steroids as this is hypersensitivity reaction
	- sometimes supplemented by antifungal with azole
