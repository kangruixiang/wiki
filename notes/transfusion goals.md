# transfusion goals

- related: [[Hemeonc]]

A hemoglobin level **>8 g/dL** is recommended in patients with stable coronary artery disease or in those planning to undergo major surgery (eg, certain orthopedic procedures).  Patients with acute coronary syndrome, severe thrombocytopenia, or cancer with a high bleeding risk may require a higher transfusion goal.  Those with massive bleeding and hemodynamic instability might require blood transfusion regardless of hemoglobin levels, as initial levels may not accurately reflect the amount of blood loss **(Choice D)**.
