# HIV exposure

<!-- healthcare HIV exposure types, management -->

At risk exposures:

- **Percutaneous injury** from a contaminated needlestick or sharp object (eg, scalpel)

- **Mucous membrane** (eg, eyes) or **nonintact skin** exposure to infected body fluids
  Types of risks:

- High risk:  **Blood**, fluids contaminated with visible blood, semen, and vaginal secretions

- Possible risk:  Cerebrospinal, synovial, pleural, pericardial, and amniotic fluids

- Low risk: Body fluids such as **urine**, feces, tears, and vomitus are considered **noninfectious** if no visible blood is present.
  Testing:

- The exposed patient should be tested for HIV immediately, 4 to 6 weeks later, and 3 months after the exposure.
  PEP:

- Generally, 3 drug PEP (tenofovir, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir) is offered to patients with any risk of occupational transmission as guided by exposure type and body fluid involved.

- A two-drug regimen for postexposure prophylaxis (compared with pre-exposure prophylaxis) is no longer recommended.

- Protease inhibitors such as darunavir, whether boosted or not, are not recommended for prophylaxis because of their higher rates of adverse effects.

- Postexposure prophylaxis antiretroviral therapy has been used successfully for many years in uninfected persons to prevent infection after occupational and nonoccupational HIV exposure.

- Prophylaxis should be started as soon as possible after exposure; it is not recommended if more than 72 hours have passed. A three-drug regimen is given for 4 weeks; the preferred regimen is tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine plus either raltegravir or dolutegravir.

- HIV testing of the exposed person should be conducted at baseline and at 4 to 6 weeks and 3 months after exposure. **[FigureÂ 22][1]** shows an algorithm for evaluation of possible HIV exposure.
