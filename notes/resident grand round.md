- Why important to determine volume status
- Physical exam
	- why blood pressure is poor measurement of volume status
		- low BP = shock
		- different types of shock
		- several other factors (al mehdi slide)
		- ![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/20210828135357.png)
	- weight
	- postural hypotension
	- dry mucous membrane
	- poor skin turgor, confusion
	- edema
		- avoid term fluid overload
		- use edema present instead
		- https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/15/4/557
		- "When vascular tone is preserved, such as in hypovolemic shock, a positive response to fluid will result in an increase in arterial pressure, but this may not be the case when vascular tone is decreased, such as in sepsis"
- Urinary
	- UA
	- urine specific gravity, osm
	- BUN/Cr
	- FENA, FeUrea
	- urine output
		- "In patients with oliguria, urine output cannot be used to assess the effects of fluids, because the response is too slow, but a positive urine output response to a fluid challenge supports the need to give more fluid."
- Cardiac exam
	- JVD
	- POCUS
- Pulmonary exam
	- crackles lung
	- POCUS
- Invasive and noninvasive monitoring ICU specific
	- CVP
	- PPV
	- straight leg raise
	- POCUS IVC

## Determining Volume Status

- Why important
	- all diseases in hospital converge to volume status problem
		- heart failure, cirrhosis, ESRD => volume overload
		- septic shock, pancreatitis, infection => low volume or third spacing
		- AKI

## Hypovolemia

- sunken eyes
- dry mucous membrane
- poor skin turgor
- confusion
- ICU: pulse pressure, paeeive leg raise

## Hypervolemia

- CVP: can increase with increase R pressure: pHTN, PS, lung disease, left heart disease

### postural hypotension

## CVP

- determines CVP and not volume status
- high positive LR 8.9
- negative LR: 0.3
- \+hepatojugular reflex: LR 8
- indicates heart/lung problem in patients with ascites/edema

## CO

- ICU monitoring
- PPV, CO, frank starling curve
- straight leg raise test

## Putting it all together

- low blood pressure is not indicator for low volume status
- multiple physical exam signs are more useful as indicator, except in elderly patients
