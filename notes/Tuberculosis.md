This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with **active pulmonary tuberculosis** (TB), which is typically due to the reactivation of latent disease.  Suspicion should be raised when individuals with epidemiologic risk  factors for exposure (eg, substance abuse, homelessness, birth in a  TB-endemic region) develop characteristic clinical manifestations (eg,  fever, cough >2 weeks, weight loss).

Diagnostic evaluation begins with **chest x-ray** to determine if there are signs of active disease such as upper lobe  cavitation (70%-80%), hilar lymphadenopathy, or pleural effusion.  Patients with suspicious x-ray findings are definitively diagnosed when _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ is isolated in body fluid or tissue (lung, pleura).

**Sputum sampling** provides the least invasive and costly route for microbial  confirmation. Three single sputum samples (spontaneous or induced) are  submitted in 8- to 24-hour intervals with at least 1 early-morning  sample. Sputum should be sent for **acid-fast bacillus smear**, **mycobacterial culture**, and nucleic acid amplification testing.

Although patients with suspected pulmonary TB should also undergo tuberculin  skin testing or interferon-gamma release assay, these tests cannot  distinguish between active and latent disease and are ordered primarily  to support the diagnosis (positive test results suggest exposure)

**Sputum acid-fast bacillus** (AFB) **smear** is the most rapid, least expensive, and widely used diagnostic test for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). However, this test cannot be used to  definitively rule in/out the diagnosis due to:

- **Low sensitivity** (45%-80%) - microscopic detection of AFB requires a high burden of organisms (>10,000 bacilli/mL), so **false negatives are common**
- **Poor differentiation** - cannot distinguish between tuberculous and nontuberculous  mycobacterium (both are AFB positive), so confirmatory testing with  mycobacterial culture or **nucleic acid amplification (NAA) testing** is required

Given this patient's positive tuberculin skin testing (indicating likely _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ exposure) and characteristic TB risk factors and clinical manifestations, **active pulmonary TB remains the most likely diagnosis**. TB can be definitively established or excluded with one or both of the following:

- **Mycobacterial culture** - takes 2-6 weeks but is considered the gold standard for microbial confirmation and drug susceptibility
- NAA testing - highly sensitive (95%) and specific (98%), and results return rapidly (<48 hours); unlike AFB smears, NAA testing can distinguish  between _M tuberculosis_ and nontuberculous mycobacteria

## TB pleural effusion

Tuberculous effusions usually present with fever, cough, pleurisy, and weight loss. Thoracentesis typically reveals a **lymphocyte-predominant**, **exudative effusion**. Although malignancy may present with similar findings, an **elevated adenosine deaminase** level strongly suggests TB. As tuberculous pleural effusions are caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to _M tuberculosis_ or its antigens, pleural fluid smear is usually aseptic (unlike tuberculous empyemas) and **pleural biopsy** is often required for diagnosis.

## Latent TB

All **health care personnel** (HCP) should receive regular (eg, annual) screening for **tuberculosis** (TB) with a tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay.  HCP who have a TST with **>10-mm** induration at 48 hours are likely to be infected with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and should undergo a chest x-ray.  Those with no chest x-ray abnormalities and no symptoms (eg, weight loss, night sweats, chronic cough) are considered to have **latent tuberculosis infection** (LTBI).

LTBI is **noninfectious**.  LTBI screening should only be offered if treatment would be considered because, for most patients, the lifetime risk of advancing to active TB is small (5%-10%).

Latent TB treatment should be undertaken only if there are no symptoms or chest x-ray evidence of active TB.

Treatment (eg, 6-9 months of isoniazid) should be offered to affected individuals who are at higher risk of developing active TB (eg, immunosuppressed individuals) or those who reside (eg, inmates) or **work** (eg, HCP) in **high-risk congregate settings**.

Because LTBI is noninfectious, affected individuals, including HCP, may continue to work **without restrictions** (even if they decline or do not complete treatment); they do not require precautions (eg, N95 mask) or an absence for a full course of treatment **(Choices C and D)**.

## Miliary TB

<!-- miliary TB pt, sx, dx, rx -->

This patient with HIV and recent incarceration has subacute, nonspecific symptoms, pancytopenia, elevated transaminases, and a diffuse pulmonary infiltrate suggesting **miliary tuberculosis** (TB).

Miliary TB denotes the widespread **hematogenous** dissemination of _Myobacterium tuberculosis_ from the lungs to multiple organs.  Risk is significantly higher in patients with deficits in cell-mediated immunity (eg, **HIV**, tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors).  Symptoms usually arise **over weeks** and include fever, night sweats, weight loss, weakness, cough, and dyspnea.  Liver (eg, right upper quadrant pain, vomiting, transaminitis) and hematologic (eg, anemia, leukopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia) manifestations are common.

Miliary TB is classically associated with a **diffuse nodular infiltrate** on chest imaging.  Diagnosis usually requires the identification of _M tuberculosis_ by fluid culture or biopsy with culture; **liver biopsy** is generally considered to have the highest diagnostic yield, but bone marrow and transbronchial biopsies are sometimes performed.  All patients should receive mycobacterial blood cultures, but diagnostic sensitivity is low.
