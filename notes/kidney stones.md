## Management

Acute management of symptomatic nephrolithiasis is aimed at ==pain management and facilitation of stone passage==. Pain can be relieved by ==NSAIDs and opioids== as needed. Stone passage decreases with size. ==Only 50% of stones >6 mm will pass, and stones >10 mm are extremely unlikely to pass spontaneously==. Medications, including ==tamsulosin, nifedipine, silodosin, and tadalafil==, appear to increase the rate of spontaneous passage for most stones and can be considered for stones <10 mm.

==Urologic intervention== is required in all patients with evidence of ==infection, acute kidney injury, intractable nausea or pain, and stones that fail to pass==. This may necessitate shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy with laser ablation, or percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

Patients should strain their urine to ==collect stone fragments== for chemical analysis if the type of stone is unknown. In addition to the initial evaluation previously described, a ==24-hour urine== for measurement of volume, calcium, oxalate, citrate, uric acid, and sodium should be collected on all recurrent stone formers.

==Increased fluid intake== is the most important intervention to prevent recurrent disease regardless of stone composition. ==Urine output should be >2500 mL/d== to decrease urine solute concentration.

Other interventions should be based on findings in the metabolic workup and stone analysis.

If **hypercalciuria** is present, ==calcium excretion can be decreased by the use of thiazide diuretics==. Because calcium excretion parallels sodium excretion, ==limiting sodium intake== will also lower urine calcium. Unless excessive, ==dietary calcium should not be restricted== because this will increase oxalate absorption. Oxalate excretion can be decreased by ==limiting foods high in oxalate== such as nuts, cocoa, spinach, rhubarb, and beets. ==Potassium citrate or potassium bicarbonate== will increase urinary citrate excretion. An additional benefit of potassium citrate is a decrease in renal calcium excretion, possibly related to preventing calcium release from bone.

In patients with **uric acid** stones, management consists of increasing the solubility of uric acid by ==alkalinizing the urine with potassium citrate or bicarbonate==; ==allopurinol== can be beneficial if uric acid excretion is elevated.

**Urinary cystine** excretion can be reduced by ==limiting sodium intake and by alkalizing the urine to a pH >7.0==. If unsuccessful, additional interventions may be required.

**Struvite** stones typically require ==urologic intervention==. Before any surgical procedure, it is important that active infection be treated with antibiotics to avert sepsis. To prevent recurrent stone formation, all stone fragments must be removed from the kidney. In patients unable to undergo surgery, the ==urease inhibitor acetohydroxamic acid== may reduce urine alkalinity and decrease stone growth; however, this is best used as an adjunct to urologic intervention.

## Calcium oxalate

- risk: Hypercalciuria; hyperoxaluria; hypocitraturia
- urine: dumbbell shaped calcium mononhydrate, envelope shaped calcium dihydrate
- treatment: Increase fluids, Decrease sodium intake, Thiazide diuretics, Low oxalate diet, Potassium citrate or bicarbonate
- [[calcium renal stones]]

## Calcium phosphate

- risk: Elevated urine pH; distal renal tubular acidosis; hyperparathyroidism. ==Topamax==
- urine: amorphous crystals, alkaline urine
- treatment: Increase fluids, Decrease sodium intake, Thiazide diuretics, Treat hyperparathyroidism, Potassium citrate or bicarbonate

## Uric acid

- risk: Low urine pH; diarrhea; metabolic syndrome; gout; hyperuricosuria
- treatment: Increase fluids, alkalinize urine with potassium citrate or bicarbonate, Allopurinol
- allopurinol is not main treatment
- note: urine pH from UA is not as good as from 24 hour urine because of acute infection

## Struvite

- risk: Chronic urinary tract infections with urea-splitting organism
- treatment: Treat infection, urologic intervention

## cystine

- risk:Cystinuria; low urine pH
- treatment: Increase fluids, Potassium citrate or bicarbonate, Acetazolamide, Penicillamine, Tiopronin
