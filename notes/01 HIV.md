# Screening

## Risks

- MSM
- Heterosexual, multiple partners
- IVDU
- Treated for hemophilia, blood transfusion 1978-85
- Newly diagnosed TB, hep B, hep C
- pregnant women
- infant exposed to HIV

## Frequency

- Annual screening
- In active MSM: 3-6 months
- Pregnant women: 3rd trimester
- Partner with HIV: every 6-12 months

# Symptoms

- Acute: fever, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, rash

- Chronic: wax/waning lymphadenopathy

- Opportunistic: PCP, esophageal candidiasis, cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasma

- Cancers: B lymphoma, Hodgkin, CNS lymphoma

# Diagnosis

## Initial Test

### HIV Ag/Ab

- 4th gen HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody combination test
- decreased window period of 10 days
- If negative and suspect HIV, use RNA PCR and retest in 4-12 wks

### RNA PCR

- High false positive in chronic infection
- Good for acute infection if initial test negative because initial viral load is very high in HIV

### Others

- CD4, viral load, HIV genotype
- Cancers: Anal cancer screening
- Health: A1C, lipid, UA
- Infections: Tb, RPR, CG, Gonorrhea, hepatitis, Pap
- Others: pregnancy, testosterone

### Routine

- women: pap smear 2x 1st year of care, then annually if negative

# Management

## Principle

- Goal: undetectable as long as possible, CD4 as high as possible
- Pt may have blips of transietn viral load
- drug interaction increases with age
	- Statin/topical steroids with protease inhibitors
	- metformin with dolutegravir

## Interval Testing

- CD4 percentage: good measurement of long term response because measured directly
- CD4 cell count: derived from CBC. Vary widely
- viral load measured 2-8 weeks after therapy initiation to assure response and adherance
- 3 - 6 months interval testing of CD4 and viral load. 6 - 12 months if under control for 2 years

## Prophylaxis

- CD 4 > 200 for 3 months => discontinue primary prophylaxis

## Immunizations

- Pneumococcal: PCV13, when CD4 > 200 => PV23 8 wks after 13, 5 yrs later, and at 65
- Hep A, B
- HPV: - 26 yo
- VSV: CD4 > 200
- Tdap
- Meningococcus: 2 doses 2 months apart, then q5y

## Prregnant women

- ART and then zidovudine during labor/delivery
- neonates receive zidovudine for 4-6 wks
- avoid breast feeding
- vaginal delivery safe if prenatal viral load < 1000 copies/mL
