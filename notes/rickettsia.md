**Rocky Mountain spotted fever** (RMSF) is a **tick-borne** illness caused by _Rickettsia rickettsii_. The classic triad of symptoms includes **fever**, **headache**, and **rash**. Early nonspecific manifestations (eg, fever, nausea, myalgias, arthralgias) are followed by the development of **erythematous macules** on the **wrists** and **ankles** around days 3-5 of illness. Rash may spread to the trunk, palms, and soles, and macules often evolve into **petechiae**. Although initial leukocyte count is typically normal, **thrombocytopenia**, hyponatremia, and transaminitis are characteristic.

RMSF is diagnosed presumptively based on clinical findings as serologic testing is generally negative in early disease. **Empiric** antibiotics are initiated as soon as possible without waiting for  confirmatory test results, as a delay in treatment can lead to serious  complications (eg, encephalitis, pulmonary edema, arrhythmia) and  increased mortality. **Doxycycline** is the recommended  antibiotic for all patients, including children and pregnant women. The risk of teeth discoloration is minimal with a short treatment course;  no other medications are as safe and effective.
