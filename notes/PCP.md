<!-- PCP and HIV, when, imaging, diagnosis, rx -->

_Pneumocystis jirovecii_ pneumonia:

- usually presents as a subacute illness with ==fever, dyspnea, and dry cough== in a patient with a CD4 cell count less than 200/µL who is not receiving prophylaxis.
- Chest radiographs most often show ==bilateral interstitial infiltrates==; cavitation or pleural effusion is unusual and suggests another diagnosis. A normal chest radiograph does not exclude the diagnosis, and chest CT is more sensitive, demonstrating patchy “ground-glass” opacities.
- The most commonly described **radiographic** appearance in PCP is interstitial infiltrates (unilateral, bilateral, or diffuse), although a normal chest x-ray can be seen.  **Thin-walled cavitary** lesions may be present.  Spontaneous **pneumothorax** develops in approximately 5% of PCP patients.  Pneumothorax is thought to develop primarily in the setting of rupture of cystic lesions that may be present in active disease or remaining from an earlier infection.
- ==Normal lactate dehydrogenase== levels and stable exercise oxygen saturation have a ==high negative predictive value==, but elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels and oxygen desaturation with exercise are nonspecific.
- Diagnosis depends on demonstration of causative organisms and often requires bronchoscopy.
- The treatment of choice is high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; patients who are hypoxic at presentation should be given adjunctive glucocorticoids to prevent the worsening that may accompany initiation of treatment.

## PCP Steroids when

<!-- PCP pneumonia steroids when -->

Patients with HIV who have moderate or severe _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia (PCP) often have **respiratory decompensation** during the first 2-3 days of treatment due to organism lysis, which  stimulates an inflammatory response. To reduce the risk of intubation  and death, **corticosteroids** are used in those with arterial blood gas (ABG) evidence of **alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient >35 mm Hg** and/or arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) <70 mm Hg (on room air).

Some research suggests that pulse oxymetry readings <92% indicate a need  for corticosteroids (without ABG). However, ABG remains the standard of care and helps determine whether intravenous antibiotics and  hospitalization in the intensive care unit are needed.
