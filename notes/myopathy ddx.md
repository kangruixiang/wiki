**Myopathy** occurs in approximately one-third of patients  with hypothyroidism and can range from an asymptomatic elevation in CK  to myalgias, muscle hypertrophy, proximal myopathy, and rhabdomyolysis.  Serum CK can be elevated for years before a patient develops clinical  symptoms of hypothyroidism, and there is no clear correlation between  the degree of CK elevation and severity of muscle disease. Inflammatory markers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) may be normal or mildly elevated. Initial testing should include **TSH and free T4 levels**.
