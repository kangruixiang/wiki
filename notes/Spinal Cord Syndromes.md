# Peripheral Neuropathy

<!-- peripheral neuropathy is.. -->

**Peripheral neuropathy** is **any disorder of the peripheral nervous system including radiculopathies and mononeuropathies.** For more information on specific peripheral neuropathies see: cervical radiculopathy, lumbosacral radiculopathy, and diabetic neuropathy.

## Causes

<!-- ignore.. -->

There are many causes of peripheral neuropathy:

- \*\*Diabetes mellitus \*\*
- **Alcohol abuse**
- **B12 deficiency**
- \*\*B6 deficiency/ toxicity \*\*
- **Heavy metal exposure (eg. lead)**
- **Rheumatologic**
- **HIV**
- **Spinal disk lesions**

<!-- peripheral neuropathy medication causes.. -->

Common medications that cause peripheral neuropathy:

- **Dapsone**
- **Daptomycin**
- **HAART therapy**
- **Chemotherapies such as vincristine and cisplatin**
- **Isoniazid**

## Symptoms

<!-- peripheral neuropathy symptoms and causes.. -->

Peripheral neuropathy typically presents with **distal sensory loss, burning, or weakness.**

Asymmetric muscle weakness can indicate:

- **Potential nerve infarction (diabetes)**
- **Vasculitis**
- **Entrapment**
- **Trauma**
- **Radiculopathy**
- \*\*Cerebral vascular accident \*\*

In the setting of a viral illness, most commonly with gastrointestinal symptoms, followed by acute weakness, consider \*\*Gullain-Barre syndrome. \*\*

Peripheral neuropathy of the hands and feet, angiokeratomas, cardiovascular and renal disease consider **Fabry’s Disease.**

Patients with a **lead exposure** will present with a peripheral neuropathy that frequently manifests with extensor weakness or "**wrist/ankle drop**" due to an axonal degeneration that primarily affects motor nerves.

Patients with chronic neuropathy associated with weakness may present with **muscle wasting**. This is typically seen in carpal tunnel syndrome.

<!-- neuropathy vs mopathy.. -->

If the etiology of the patient’s peripheral neuropathy is unclear, perform a nerve conduction study with EMG to differentiate between neuropathy and myopathy. **EMG in neuropathy will reveal denervation potentials, fibrillations and positive sharp waves while EMGs studies in myopathies will reveal motor unit action potentials that are small and polyphasic.**

## Treatment

<!-- ignore.. -->

In general, the treatment for a peripheral neuropathy is to **identify and treat the underlying cause.**

# Cervical Radiculopathy

## Causes

<!-- cervical radiculopathy is, causes, disc herniation vs spondylosis timelne.. -->

Cervical radiculopathy, one of the most common causes of neck pain, refers to the **damage of a cervical nerve root that transmits pain in a radicular fashion (e.g. follows a dermatome).**

Cervical radiculopathy is most commonly caused by **cervical spondylosis and disc herniation.** Less common causes include:

- **Herpes zoster**
- **Infarction**
- **Nerve root avulsion**
- **Mass effect from a tumor**
- **Demyelinating disorders**
- **Diabetic neuropathy**

The timeline of the onset of cervical radiculopathy can help aid in diagnosis:

- **Acute onset typically results from disc herniation**
- **Insidious onset typically results from cervical spondylosis**

## Cervical Spondylosis

<!-- cervical spondylosis pathogenesis.. -->

**Cervical spondylosis** is the result of **disk degeneration**:

1. Aging disks fragment, lose water, and collapse. Initially starts in the nucleus pulposus:
   1. Central annular lamellae buckling inward while the external concentric bands of the annulus fibrosis bulge outward. This causes increased mechanical stress at the cartilaginous end plates.

2. Subperiosteal bone formation occurs next, encroach on nervous tissues and cause irritations.
3. Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, a condition often seen in certain Asian populations, can occur with cervical spondylosis. This condition can be an additional contributing source of severe anterior cord compression.

## Disc Herniation

<!-- disc herniation pathophysiology.. -->

<!-- cervical radiculopathy common site.. -->

The most common site of cervical radiculopathy is at the **level of the C7 nerve root.**

## Symptoms

<!-- cervial radiculopathy symptoms and PE.. -->

Patients with cervical radiculopathy typically present with:

- **Acute or chronic onset**
- **Neck, back, or arm pain that follows a dermatome**
- **Paresthesia or numbness following a dermatome**
- **Lhermitte's phenomenon** (an electric shock down the arm following neck flexion)
- **Strength is usually preserved**
- **Pseudo-anginal pain may imitate a myocardial infarction**
- \*\*Associated symptoms suggestive of another process \*\*(e.g. fever, weight loss, incontinence, gait disturbances)

On physical examination, patients with **cervical radiculopathy** typically have:

- **Diminished reflexes**
- **Dermatomal changes in sensation and strength**
- **Spurling maneuver,** having the patient extend the neck, rotate the head towards the side of the pain and have the physician apply downward pressure. If pain occurs then the test is positive.
- **Midline neck tenderness** (for disc herniation)

## Diagnosis

<!-- cervical radiculopathy diagnosis.. -->

Cervical radiculopathy is typically diagnosed through **history and physical examination. Imaging and electrophysiologic** (e.g. EMG) **testing is indicated if symptoms do not resolve in 4 - 6 weeks or if there is localizing findings** (e.g. weakness along one myotome).

For cervical radiculopathy, imaging studies are used to confirm the diagnosis and **show displacement of the CSF or compression of the nerve root.** The preferred imaging studies include:

- **MRI as the study of choice**
- **CT myelography is the gold standard**

## Management

<!-- cervical radiculopathy management.. -->

Cervical radiculopathy is initially managed with conservative therapy including:

- **NSAIDs**
- **Short course of oral prednisone** (Deltasone)
- **Physical therapy**
- **Cervical traction**

Cervical radiculopathy that is refractory to conservative therapy or causes severe symptoms (e.g. myelopathic findings) is managed with:

- **Epidural steroid injections** (preferred over surgery)
- **Surgery**(e.g. anterior cervical discectomy with fusion, disc replacement)

# Lumbosacral Radiculopathy

<!-- lumbosacral spinal roots exit levels, forms.. -->

Roots of all lumbosacral nerves **originate in the T10 – L1 region**, descend forming the **cauda equina** and then exit the spine at their respective levels

## Cause

<!-- lumbosacral radiculopathy pathogenesis.. -->

The etiology of lumbosacral radiculopathy **includes spinal stenosis or disc herniation** leading to compression of the nerve root.

## Symptoms

<!-- L1 to S4 radiculopathy symptoms.. -->

Clinical presentation of lumbosacral radiculopathy depends on the **level of the herniation or stenosis.**

Radiculopathy at L1 is rare and presents with **sensory loss and paresthesia in the inguinal area**.

Nerves at level L2,3,4 innervate anterior thigh muscles and are responsible for hip flexion and knee extension. Radiculopathy at these levels are **commonly seen in elderly patients with spinal stenosis** and will present as an **acute back pain with radiation to the anterior aspect of the thigh**.

**L5** is the most common location for a disc herniation. Herniation of the L4-L5 disc compresses the **L5 nerve root** (responsible for great toe dorsiflexion), which **presents with back pain that radiates down the lateral** (vs posterior in S1 compressions) **aspect of the leg in to the foot**.

S1 nerve root is responsible for ankle plantar flexion. S1 radiculopathy \*\*presents with back pain that radiates down the posterior aspect of the leg in to the foot. \*\*

Radiculopathy at levels **S2, 3, 4** is rare and **presents with sacral/buttock pain radiating into the perineum. It can also be associated with urinary or fecal incontinence and impotence.**

## Diagnosis

<!-- lumbosacral radiculopathy alarming signs, next step.. -->

Urinary or fecal incontinence, new onset sexual dysfunction or saddle anesthesia are worrisome signs that need to be urgently addressed. **The next step would be to obtain MRI and neurosurgical consult.**

<!-- lumbosacral radiculopathy diagnosis.. -->

While the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy is most often clinical (based on sensory, motor and reflex deficits), \*\*neuroimaging with MRI (preferred)\*\*or CT scan is recommended for high-risk patients (e.g. progressive neurologic deficits, bladder dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, high suspicion for tumor or epidural abscess).

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/9096F327-F38C-4F8A-B562-64EE65F48E62.jpg)

## Treatment

<!-- lumbosacral radiculopathy treatment.. -->

Conservative treatment is the first step in management of lumbosacral radiculopathy. This includes:

- **NSAIDs**
- **Prednisone** can be used in severe pain
- **Physical therapy**

Neurosurgical intervention is warranted **if patient develops saddle anesthesia, urinary or fecal incontinence, sexual dysfunction.**

# Diabetic Neuropathy

<!-- ignore.. -->

Diabetic neuropathy is the **progressive loss of nerve fiber function as a result of diabetes.** **Diabetic neuropathy** is the most common complication of diabetes, affecting up to 50% of patients with diabetes.

## Pathogenesis

<!-- diabetic neuropathy pathogenesis.. -->

**As excess glucose is converted to sorbitol, the accumulation of sorbitol and fructose in neurons causes**:

- Reduced nerve myo-inositol, which is important in maintaining the cell membrane potential
- Decreased membrane Na/K-ATPase activity
- Impaired axonal transport
- Structural breakdown of the nerve

## Symptoms

<!-- diabetic neuropathy sensor, motor, autonomic, cranial nerve symptoms.. -->

Neural damage and conduction defects associated with diabetic neuropathy lead to **sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms**.

Sensory symptoms **typically begin in the feet and then progress in a stocking-glove pattern.**

Sensory symptoms include:

- **Paresthesias**
- **Neural pain**
- **Decreased vibration and position sense**
- **Loss of pain sensation**

Motor symptoms may **present distally or proximally** and can be characterized by **weakness or loss of coordination.**

Motor symptoms may include:

- **Difficulty with fine hand motor coordination**, such as turning keys or opening jars
- **Foot slapping, toe scruffing, and frequent tripping**
- **Difficulty raising arms above the shoulders**

Autonomic symptoms associated with diabetic neuropathy can include:

- **Postural hypotension**
- **Impotence**
- **Incontinence**
- **Diabetic gastroparesis**

The most common cranial nerve impacted by diabetic neuropathy is CN III. This neuropathy is caused by ischemia and infarction of CN III motor fibers that spares parasympathetic fibers. Thus, patients present with:

- **Diplopia**
- \*\*Ptosis \*\*
- **Fixed, "down and out" gaze**
- **Preserved pupillary accommodation** (spared parasympathetic fibers)

## Diagnosis

<!-- diabetic neuropathy diagnosis.. -->

The evaluation of diabetic neuropathy should include electrophysiologic testing of nerve function, including the use of **nerve conduction velocity (NCV) or electromyography (EMG).**

## Management

<!-- diabetic neuropathy treatment and prevention.. -->

The first line treatment for diabetic neuropathy is to **control diabetes**.

Neural pain can be treated with:

- **Tricyclic antidepressants**
- **Phenytoin**
- **Carbamazepine**
- **Gabapentin**

Persistent neural pain may require the use of **narcotics or tramadol**.

Preventative measures include **teaching patients how to perform regular foot examinations**to avoid complications associated with diabetic neuropathy (explained below).

## Complications

<!-- diabetic neuropathy complications.. -->

Complications associated with diabetic neuropathy include:

- **Charcot joints** (also known as neurogenic arthropathy)
- **Diabetic ulcers**, which can result in amputation from progressive infections and deformity
- An increased risk of **silent MI** due to impaired pain sensation
- Increased risks for epidural abscesses (unilateral UMN signs)

# Conus Medullaris

<!-- conus medullaris is, gives off what part of spinal cords.. -->

In adults the \*\*spinal cord terminates at the level of L1-L2 in a tapered structure know as the conus medullaris. \*\*Sacral segments S1-S5 originate from the conus medullaris.

## Causes

<!-- conus medullaris causes.. -->

Causes of conus medullaris syndrome include spinal cord compression due to:

- **Trauma**
- **Lumbar disc herniation**
- **Tumors**
- **Epidural abscess**

<!-- conus medullaris symptoms.. -->

Given that the conus medullaris is the last true segment of spinal cord and gives off the nerve roots S1-S5, conus medullaris syndrome generally manifests as a combination of **BOTH lower motor neuron and upper motor neuron signs**:

- Upper motor signs include hyperreflexia, spasticity, Babinski sign.
- Lower motor signs include hyporeflexia/areflexia, fasciculations.

One should suspect conus medullaris syndrome in a patient who presents with the following:

- **Sudden, symmetric bilateral leg weakness**
- \*\*Lower back pain \*\*
- **Hyperreflexia of lower extremity DTRs**
- \*\*Numbness to perianal area \*\*
- **Impotence**

## Management

<!-- conus medullaris management.. -->

Like cauda equina syndrome, conus medullaris syndrome is considered a **medical emergency** and requires **urgent referral to neurosurgery** for further management.

<!-- conus medullaris vs cauda equina onset, symmetry, UMN/LMN, nerve roots, reflex, sexual function, bladder/bowel.. -->

Conus medullaris syndrome can be confused with **cauda equina syndrome.** While both are considered medical emergencies, it is important to differentiate the two in clinical practice and for testing purposes.

|                            | **Cauda Equina Syndrome**       | **Conus Medullaris Syndrome** |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Onset and Pain             | Gradual severe _radicular pain_ | Sudden _back pain_            |
| Symmetric vs. Assymetric   | Assymetric                      | Symmetric                     |
| UMN vs. LMN                | LMN                             | UMN + LMN                     |
| Nerve roots affected       | L1-S5                           | S1-S5                         |
| DTR                        | Hyporeflexia/Areflexia          | Hyperreflexia                 |
| Sexual dysfunction         | Infrequent                      | Frequent                      |
| Bladder/Bowel incontinence | Late in disease course          | Early in disease course       |

# Cauda Equina

<!-- cauda equina syndrome pathogenesis.. -->

Cauda equina syndrome is an **emergent condition that refers to the compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots (L1-L5, S1-S4) distal to the conus medullaris, resulting in neuromuscular and urogenital symptoms.**

## Causes

<!-- cauda equina syndrome 2ndary cause, neoplastic causes.. -->

Cauda equina syndrome may occur secondarily to:

- **Trauma**
- **Vertebral compression fractures**
- **Disc herniation**
- **Space occupying malignancies**
- **Epidural abscess** (by mass effect or vascular compromise)
- \*\*Spinal stenosis \*\*(may be from osteoarthritis)
- \*\*Inflammatory processes \*\*(e.g. ankylosing spondylitis, tuberculosis)

Cauda equina syndrome secondary to neoplastic compression is most commonly associated with:

- **Prostate cancer**
- **Multiple myeloma**
- **Lung cancer**
- **Breast cancer**

## Symptoms

<!-- classic cauda equina triad.. -->

The classic triad of cauda equina syndrome is:

- \*\*Saddle anesthesia \*\*(anesthesia in perineal region)
- **Bowel and/or bladder dysfunction**
- **Lower extremity weakness**

## Diagnosis and Management

<!-- cauda equina diagnosis and management.. -->

**Urgent MRI of the spinal column** is the preferred initial imaging modality to evaluate a patient with suspected cauda equina syndrome.

The management of cauda equina syndrome includes:

- **Emergent surgical decompression** (e.g. laminectomy)
- **Immediate administration of dexamethasone** (Decadron)
- **For malignancies, radiation or chemotherapy postoperatively**

If left untreated, cauda equina syndrome **may cause permanent nerve damage.**

# ALS

## Pathogenesis

<!-- ignore.. -->

**Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)** is a neurodegenerative disorder **causing muscle atrophy and weakness, that ultimately leads to death.**

The spinal areas affected in ALS are the **corticospinal tract** and **ventral horn** of the spinal cord. **The disease affects both the upper and lower motor neurons but spares sensory neurons.** It is **characterized by neuronal death with gliosis** replacing the lost neurons. The etiology of the disease is unknown.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is classified as either **sporadic or familial.** The sporadic form is the most common, accounting for 90-95% of all cases of ALS.

Onset of the disease occurs between **50 and 70 years of age**.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has a poor prognosis with **80% mortality in 5 years**.

## Symptoms

**Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis** hallmark feature is the presence of both upper and lower motor neuron symptoms. Presenting symptoms include:

- **Progressive muscle weakness**
- **Muscle spasticity**
- **Fasciculations**
- **Muscle atrophy**
- **Speech and swallowing impairment**

<!-- ALS intact functions.. -->

The following are never affected in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis:

- **Sensation**
- **Extraocular muscles**
- **Sexual function**

<!-- ignore.. -->

End-stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is characterized by **respiratory failure.**

## Diagnosis

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is primarily a \*\*clinical diagnosis \*\*based on the progressive symptoms of both upper and lower motor neuron degeneration.

**Sensory and motor nerve conduction studies** and **electromyography** are a standard part of the evaluation of motor neuron disease.

Neuroimaging can be done to **rule out other possible diagnoses** in a presumed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient.

## Treatment

<!-- ALS treatment.. -->

Treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is mainly supportive, however, **riluzole** is a glutamate-blocker agent that has been shown to delay death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

# Polio

<!-- ignore.. -->

Poliomyelitis, or polio, is a viral disease that causes **inflammation of the grey matter of the spinal cord**, notably the **ventral horn**.

Symptoms of poliomyelitis include **muscle weakness** and **flaccid paralysis**.

# Syphillis

Tabes dorsalis, also known as syphilitic myelopathy, is a **spinal lesion that is the result of tertiary syphilis**. It affects the **dorsal columns** of the spinal cord.

Symptoms of **tabes dorsalis** include:

- **Weakness**
- **Paraesthesia**(shooting pain)
- **Impaired proprioception**, which manifests as a **high-stepping gait**

# ASA

Anterior spinal artery syndrome is the **most common presentation of a spinal artery infarction** because of a less efficient blood supply than the posterior spinal arteries.

The ASA is particularly dependent on blood supply from the radicular arteries that originate from the thoracic aorta, such as the artery of Adamkiewicz.  **Thoracic aortic surgery** can result in reduced blood flow through the radicular arteries (eg, from aortic cross-clamping and/or systemic hypotension) and consequently lead to anterior spinal cord infarction.

<!-- ASA symptoms.. -->

In anterior spinal artery syndrome, the motor and sensory tracts of the anterior part of the spinal cord are affected, which include:

- **Corticospinal tract**
- **Spinothalamic tract**
- **Ventral horn**
- **Lateral grey matter**

The symptoms of anterior spinal artery syndrome include:

- **Bilateral loss of pain and temp** (one level below lesion)
- **Bilateral spastic paresis** (below lesion). **Bilateral flaccid paralysis** (level of lesion - lower motor neuron symptom).
- The **flaccid paralysis is due to spinal shock**. **Upper motor neuron signs** such as spasticity and hyperreflexia subsequently develop over days to weeks.
- Symptoms of bowel and bladder dysfunction (eg, urinary retention) can result from autonomic dysfunction due to involvement of the intermediolateral cell column and its descending tracts.

# B12 Deficiency

<!-- ignore.. -->

**Vitamin B12 deficiency** leads to a spinal lesion called subacute combined degeneration, which results in **demyelination of neurons in the dorsal columns** and **corticospinal tract**.

The symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency related spinal lesions are a **loss of vibration and discrimination** and a **spastic paresis** affecting the legs first, both occurring bilaterally. Note that B12 deficiency can also lead to **ataxia, altered mental status, dementia, personality changes, fatigue, and hyperreflexia.**

<!-- Subacute combined deficiency ddx.. -->

Subacute combined deficiency can also be caused by vitamin E deficiency. By looking at **blood work**, you can determine the cause of subacute combined degeneration - B12 deficiency causes **megaloblastic anemia** and vitamin E deficiency causes **hemolytic anemia**.

# Syringomyelia

<!-- ignore.. -->

Syringomyelia is the **development of a centralized cavity (syrinx) within the spinal cord**, which expands and compresses adjacent neural tissue.

The spinal tracts affected in syringomyelia are the **ventral horn** and **ventral white commissure**.

The symptoms of syringomyelia include **bilateral loss of pain and temperature** one level below the lesion and **bilateral flaccid paralysis** at the level of the lesion.

## Pathogenesis

<!-- syringomyelia pathogenesis.. -->

The exact pathophysiology of syringomyelia is unknown, but **involves post-traumatic cystic degeneration of the spinal cord.**

Central cord syndrome (CCS) typically occurs with hy**perextension injuries in elderly patients** with pre-existing degenerative changes in the cervical spine.

<!-- syringomyelia demographics.. -->

Syringomyelia is most common amongst **men** between the **third and fourth decades of life**.

<!-- ignore.. -->

In the early stage, syringomyelia first presents with **loss of pain and temperature sensation** due to pressure on the anterior white commissure, which affects the spinothalamic tracts. The initial presentation is commonly referred to as a **cape like** distribution of loss, first affecting the back and arms.

As the cavity within the spinal canal continues to expand and affect the ventral horns, neurological symptoms include:

- **Flaccid paralysis**
- **Decreased deep tendon reflexes**
- **Fasciculations**

CCS is characterized by weakness that is more pronounced in the **upper extremities** than the lower.

MRI is used in syringomyelia to visualize **expansion of the syrinx**.

<!-- syringomyelia treatment.. -->

Treatment of syringomyelia involves **surgical decompression**, with **shunting indicated in recurrent cases**.

# Brown-Sequard

<!-- ignore.. -->

Brown-Sequard is a **spinal lesion that is the result of a lateral hemisection of the spinal cord**, \*\*which affects all tracts on that side \*\*of the spinal cord.

Because all spinal tracts are affected in Brown-Sequard syndrome, the symptoms include:

- **Ipsilateral loss of vibration and discrimination below the lesion**
- **Ipsilateral spastic paresis below the lesion**
- **Ipsilateral flaccid paralysis at the level of the lesion**
- **Contralateral loss of pain and temperature two levels below the lesion** (the spinothalamic tract ascends contralaterally in the spinal cord)

# Alcoholic Cerebellar Degeneration

<!-- Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration cause, symptoms, PE, imaging, treatment.. -->

- cause:  **>10 years** heavy alcohol use. Degeneration of Purkinje cells (**cerebellar vermis**)  responsible for truncal coordination
- symptoms:
	- Usually develops over weeks to months
	- **Wide-based gait**
	- Incoordination in legs
	- Cognition usually intact
- PE:
	- Impaired tandem walking/heel-knee-shin
	- Preserved finger-nose testing
- diagnosis:
	- CT/MRI - cerebellar atrophy
- treatment: alcohol cessation, nutrient supplementation
