<!-- symptomatic carotid artery disease dx, management -->

This patient developed transient right-sided motor weakness and slurred speech with no evidence of infarction on MRI, suggesting a **transient ischemic attack** (TIA).  Right-sided motor symptoms usually indicate a lesion in the vascular distribution of the left middle cerebral artery, a branch of the left internal carotid artery.  MR angiogram of this vessel demonstrated significant stenosis, indicating **symptomatic carotid artery disease**.

Symptomatic carotid artery disease is diagnosed when a patient with carotid stenosis develops a TIA or nondisabling stroke in the vascular distribution of the diseased vessel.  Manifestations typically arise due to either low-flow states (obstructing lesions) or embolic disease.

Patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease who have **high-grade** (eg, 70%-99%) stenosis and a life expectancy â‰¥5 years should undergo **carotid endarterectomy** (CEA) to reduce future risk of stroke.  However, the risks of CEA likely outweigh any potential benefits for patients who are poor surgical candidates (eg, multiple medical comorbidities), those with an ipsilateral stroke with persistent disabling neurologic deficits, and those with 100% occlusion of the internal carotid artery.

Surgical management of lower-grade (<70%) lesions is debated among expert panels and depends on sex of the patient and the presence or absence of symptoms.  In many cases, patients with such lesions are managed medically only.  For all patients with carotid artery disease, medical management includes aspirin, statin, and the control of atherosclerotic risk factors (eg, hypertension, hyperglycemia, smoking).
