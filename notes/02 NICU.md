<!-- bronchopulmonary dysplasia path, demographics, diagnosis, treatment, complication -->

- Patho: longterm consequence of RDS:
	- Decreased surfactant, derecruitment of alveoli, lungs underdeveloped, O2 can't get to lung, lung scars
- Demographics: premature infant with increase O2 demand who gets:
	- Increase FiO2 (risk for other things) > 28 days
	- Lung protective strategy to keep pressure down to avoid damage
- Diagnosis: Xray, ground glass opacities
- Treatment: surfactant postnatal. Corticosteroids to mom antenatal
- complication: Diffused parenchymal lung disease from scarring.,

# Retinopathy of Prematurity

<!-- retinopathy of prematurity path, demo, diagnosis, treatment, complication.. -->

- patho: neoangiogenesis, worsened by increased FiO2
- Demographics: premature infant, increased FiO2
- Diagnosis: eye exams for all premature babies, see blood vessels
- Treatment: laser ablavation
- complication: eye blindness, early glaucoma even after treatment

# Intraventricular Hemorrhage

<!-- IVH path, demographcis, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, complications -->

- path: highly vascular ventricles (involutes around wk 34), change in BP (septic shock, fluids)
- demographics: premature before wk 34, screened with cranial doppler and imaged later on
- symptoms: bulging fontanelles, ICP
- diagnosis: cranial doppler
- treatment: decreased ICP via surgery. VP shunts, drainage
