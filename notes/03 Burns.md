# Degrees

- 1st: sunburns, epidermis intact, erythema/warmth/pain
- 2nd: partial thickness, broken epidermis, increased pain, **blisters**, infection/fluid become issue
- 3rd: full thickness, through dermis, muscle/bone exposed. No pain. White charred region of flesh. Surrounded by second degree

# Chemical

- alkali/acid
- alkali worse
- skin/eyes
	- never buffer. Irrigate with water
- Ingested
	- never buffer. Never induce emesis. Never NG (can perforate esophagus)
	- Monitor. Serial exams (repeat xray, NPO, watch). Eventual EGD
- Respiratory: hot stuff in respiratory (close fires, explosions, inhalation)
	- edema response to burn = close airway
	- **signs:** Stridor, soot/singed nares
	- treatment: monitor O2/ABG, peak flow, eventual bronchoscopy. Prophylactic intubation if deterioration

# Electrical

- pt: struck by lightning, high voltage wires, entrance/exit wound
- symptoms:
	- die from arrythmia
	- bones heat up and burns muscles around it = rhabdo
	- posterior shoulder dislocation (nerves contract with such force that shoulder dislocates)
- management: if still alive, ck level, cr
- may need IVF, mannitol

# Circumferential burns

- any burns that's circumferential compromises vascular supplies
- regular burn vs circumferential:

- 4xkgx%BSA = how much fluid to give
- give 50% in first 8 hours, 50% in next 16 hours
- early movement and early grafting is key with IV analgesics, infection prophylaxis (topical mupirocin, sulfadiazeine, PO don't count)
