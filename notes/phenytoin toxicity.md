# phenytoin toxicity

It is important to recognize the early signs and symptoms of phenytoin toxicity.   The earliest sign is the presence of **nystagmus on far lateral gaze**.  Some other effects include blurred vision, diplopia, ataxia, slurred speech, dizziness, drowsiness, lethargy, and decreased mentation, which progresses to coma.  Systemic side effects and neurotoxicity is one of the major limitations to the use of phenytoin.

Usual therapeutic range of phenytoin is between 10-20 mcg/mL and most patients will experience adverse dose related neurotoxic effects with levels greater than 20 mcg/mL.  However, the serum levels associated with neurotoxicity vary from patient to patient.  Some patients can experience side effects even when the measured levels are within the normal therapeutic range.  The first step in the management of side effects due to higher drug levels is to reduce the dose or alter the treatment schedule to minimize the peak drug levels.  Therefore, in this vignette, the dose of phenytoin should be reduced and patient should be observed for resolution of nystagmus.

Oral contraceptive pills do not affect the drug level of phenytoin.  Conversely, chronic phenytoin therapy can cause failure in contraception by enhancing the metabolism of oral contraceptive pills through the induction of hepatic enzymes.
