In healthy couples, the probability of pregnancy (eg, fecundability) is 15%-30% per menstrual cycle. Based on average fecundability rates, 80%-90% will become pregnant within a year of unprotected intercourse. In women age <35, **infertility** is the inability to conceive after **>12 months** of appropriately timed intercourse without contraception. Infertility evaluation may be initiated if this couple fails to conceive in 12 months; however, **no further testing is indicated** at this time. In women age >35, an infertility evaluation may be performed at >6 months without conception due to decreased ovarian reserve and decreased fecundability.
