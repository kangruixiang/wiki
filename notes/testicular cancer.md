This patient has a firm, uniformly enlarged testicle that does not transilluminate, raising concern for **testicular cancer**.

Testicular cancer is the most common solid tumor in men age 15-35.  Risk is greatest in those with cryptorchidism, but individuals with HIV are at slightly elevated risk.  Most patients have **painless, unilateral testicular enlargement**.  Examination usually reveals a firm, hard testicle, with or without nodules, that **does not transilluminate**.

The initial test of choice for evaluating a testicular mass is **bilateral scrotal ultrasound**.  If ultrasound reveals a solid lesion, further work-up with serum tumor markers (eg, alpha-fetoprotein, Î²-hCG) and screening CT scans is typically required.  Most patients then undergo radical inguinal orchiectomy to establish a tissue diagnosis.  Radical orchiectomy plus chemotherapy is usually curative; 5-year survival rates are approximately 95%.
