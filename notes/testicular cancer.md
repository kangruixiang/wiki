This patient’s presentation is concerning for testicular cancer.  The majority (95%) of testicular cancers are ==germ cell tumors== (GCT), which are further divided into ==seminomas and non-seminomatous tumors==.  Testicular malignancies classically present as ==painless scrotal swelling==.

Patients with suspected testicular cancer on physical examination should undergo ==testicular ultrasound== to differentiate ==cystic from hypoechoic== (more likely malignant) lesions.  In addition, ultrasound can also rule out hydrocele or epididymitis.  After the ultrasound, a staging work-up should be performed.  A ==CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis== is required in all patients since testicular cancer initially spreads to the regional retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  In addition, ==a chest x-ray and tumor markers== should also be obtained.  Non-seminomas typically have elevated ==AFP and/or β-hCG==.  Pure seminomas may have elevated ==β-hCG==, but AFP is usually not elevated.  Thus, these tumor markers either alone or in combination are insufficient to establish a diagnosis of testicular cancer.

## Definitive diagnosis and histology is confirmed by ==inguinal orchiectomy==.  ==Biopsy procedures (e.g., fine needle aspiration, incisional biopsy) are contraindicated== due to the risk of local seeding and poorer outcomes **(Choices A and B)**.  Histologic distinction is important, since the treatment differs for seminomas (usually chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) and non-seminomas (usually chemotherapy).

This patient has a firm, uniformly enlarged testicle that does not transilluminate, raising concern for **testicular cancer**.

Testicular cancer is the most common solid tumor in men age 15-35.  Risk is greatest in those with cryptorchidism, but individuals with HIV are at slightly elevated risk.  Most patients have **painless, unilateral testicular enlargement**.  Examination usually reveals a firm, hard testicle, with or without nodules, that **does not transilluminate**.

The initial test of choice for evaluating a testicular mass is **bilateral scrotal ultrasound**.  If ultrasound reveals a solid lesion, further work-up with serum tumor markers (eg, alpha-fetoprotein, β-hCG) and screening CT scans is typically required.  Most patients then undergo radical inguinal orchiectomy to establish a tissue diagnosis.  Radical orchiectomy plus chemotherapy is usually curative; 5-year survival rates are approximately 95%.
