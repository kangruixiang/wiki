# Entamoeba Histolytica

<!-- A 43-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to 4 days of fever, malaise, nausea, anorexia, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The patient was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C infection 2 years ago but has not received any treatment. He has no other  medical problems and takes no medications. The patient recently  returned from a 4-week trip to South America where he had several episodes of diarrhea that improved with oral ciprofloxacin.  He has been home for 2 months and has not had recurrences of the  diarrhea. The patient does not use tobacco or alcohol but has a remote  history of injection drug use. He has a dog that lives with him.  Temperature is 38.3 C (101 F), blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, and pulse is 110/min. The abdomen is soft and nondistended with marked right upper quadrant tenderness. Ultrasonography reveals a 6-cm hypoechoic lesion in the right hepatic lobe. Fine-needle aspiration of the lesion reveals thick, dark brown fluid. Gram stain of the fluid is negative for microorganisms. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current condition? -->

Entamoeba infection

This patient who recently spent several weeks in  South America has fever, right upper quadrant pain, and a hypoechoic  liver lesion indicating likely extraintestinal **_Entamoeba histolytica_**.

_E histolytica_ is a **protozoa** transmitted via the ingestion of contaminated food or water.  Prevalence is high in regions with poor sanitation; carriage rates  approach 50% in parts of India, Africa, Mexico, and Central/**South America**.  Although the majority of infections are asymptomatic, approximately 10% develop amebic dysentery or, more rarely, extraintestinal disease of  the liver, lung, heart, or brain.

**Amebic liver abscess** is the most common manifestation of extraintestinal disease. Risk is  greatest in men in the fourth or fifth decade of life with underlying  cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis (as this possibly allows for easier  seeding of the liver with organisms). Manifestations typically begin  8-20 weeks after inoculation and include **fever**, **right upper quadrant pain**, and nonspecific symptoms (eg, malaise, nausea). A recent history of dysentery is present in <35% of patients.

Imaging usually reveals a round, well-defined hypoechoic mass in the right hepatic lobe. Diagnosis is made with blood **serology** and antigen detection; aspiration is not required but is often  performed if a cyst is large (rupture risk) or if an alternate diagnosis requires exclusion. Aspirate typically resembles "anchovy paste" and  is often aseptic with a negative Gram stain.

Hydatid cysts are due to the tapeworm _Echinococcus granulosus_.  Cysts tend to grow slowly over years and remain asymptomatic until the  size is >10 cm. Fever is rare without cyst rupture.

Pyogenic and amebic liver abscesses often result in similar clinical and radiographic pictures. Differentiation is typically made using _E histolytica_ serologic or antigen testing for those with possible exposure. If testing is  negative or uncertainty remains, fine needle aspiration can usually  differentiate the etiology; pathogens that cause pyogenic liver abscess  are usually identified by culture and Gram stain of aspirate fluid  (unlike in this patient).
