- AKI is either oliguric or nonoliguric
- prerenal AKI: responds to fluids
- ATN = AKI + one of following
	- not responding to fluids
	- labs: UNa, FENA, casts
- Contrast AKI happens more often with 2 hits, contrast + one of following
	- nsaids
	- ckd
	- ace/arb
	- diabetes
- [CKD-epi calculator](https://www.mdcalc.com/ckd-epi-equations-glomerular-filtration-rate-gfr) is better than Cr or GFR alone

Prerenal azotemia is associated with decreased fractional excretion of sodium; however, once ATN sets in, the fractional excretion of sodium increases (usually >2).  Response to a ==fluid challenge== is the gold standard in ==distinguishing prerenal azotemia (which responds to a fluid challenge with improved urine output) from ATN==.  This patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine despite receiving continuous intravenous hydration and showing no signs of hypovolemia (normotension, no tachycardia) suggest ATN.
