**Testosterone replacement therapy** (TRT) should be ==considered only in men with clinically significant **androgen deficiency==** (eg, low libido, erectile dysfunction, loss of body hair, gynecomastia, decreased bone density, testicular atrophy) and an **==unequivocally low** morning serum **testosterone** level== (eg, <200-300 ng/dL, depending on the reference).  ==Nonspecific symptoms== (eg, fatigue, weakness, weight changes) ==do not usually respond to TRT== and do not warrant testing or treatment in most cases.  Testosterone levels show significant variability; if the initial testosterone level is low, it should be confirmed on **repeat testing**.  In addition, providers should ==consider measuring free testosterone levels==, as variations in the levels of sex hormone–binding globulin, which may be decreased in certain conditions (eg, obesity, diabetes), can cause misleading total testosterone results.

**==Contraindications==** to TRT include ==breast or prostate cancer, polycythemia, severe lower urinary tract symptoms== (ie, American Urological Association score >19), ==unstable heart failure==, ==PSA >4 ng/mL== (>3 ng/mL in high-risk patients), and **==untreated obstructive sleep apnea==** (OSA).  This patient has an elevated hematocrit, hypertension, obesity, and a large neck circumference, which together suggest possible OSA.  TRT can ==worsen OSA and exacerbate erythrocytosis==, with a possible ==increased risk of venous thromboembolism==.  The patient also has multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and some evidence suggests that TRT may increase this risk.  As a result, the risks likely outweigh the benefits of TRT in this patient.  In addition, TRT is indicated for specific disorders of gonadal function (eg, chemotherapy-induced hypogonadism), but TRT for age-related declines in serum testosterone is considered an off-label use.

Although erectile dysfunction is a significant symptom in men with hypogonadism, TRT has shown inconsistent benefits in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in older men.  Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (eg, sildenafil) are more likely to be effective.
