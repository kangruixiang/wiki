<!-- preoperative shaving? -->

- Preoperative shaving in the area of the planned incision increases the risk of SSI. Shaving causes microscopic abrasions of the skin, which promotes bacterial proliferation. Recommendations indicate only removing hair from the surgical site if it will interfere with the procedure, in which case clipping is preferred.
