## Mid systolic click

Mitral valve prolapse. Apex. No treatment

## Inclusion bodies on biopsy for colitis

CMV, transplant. Ganciclovir

## Bleeding while on. Antidote

- ASA: platelets
- plavix: platelets, desmopressin
- coumadin: FPP, K, PCC
- Heparin: if bleeding give blood. Wait if not bleeding
- factor xa inhibitors: activated charcoal if in 2 hours
- direct thrombin inhibitors: responds to hemodialysis

## chylous ascites on paracentesis

- lymphatic injury or destruction
- Lymphoma or any retroperitoneal obstruction. High TG

## Pt with von wille brand

- bleeding time abnormality
- desmopressin, cryopreciptate

## Tardive Dyskinesia

- 1st gen antipsychotics
- treatment with benztropine, diphenhydramine

## nosebleed unresponsive from nasal packing

posterior, sphenopalatine artery

## Transplant rejection

- types
- hyperacute: seconds. ABO. HLA. Immediate removal
- acute: days/months. T cell mediated. Immunosuppression/steroids. Diagnosis with biopsy to differentiate from chronic.
- chronic: months/years. Gradual fibrosis, loss of function. Retransplant

## Pediatric cardiac anomalies

## Local Anesthesics

- Esters (1 i) and Amides
- Esters more prone to allergic

## Ophtho

- ulcerative conjunctivitis: herpes
- diabetic with cotton wool spot. Sudden eye pain: central retinal **vein** occlusion
- Atherosclerotic, painless: artery occlusion
- Pt with MS, painful loss of vision: optic neuritis

## Carpel Tunnel

- compression median nerve
- PE: tinnel, phalen
- work up: EMG is indirect. Don't pick. Pick nerve conduction study
- treatment: nsaids, splinting, then CTR

## Hidradenitis

- apocrine (arm pits, groin, but) inflammation

## PDA

- treatment: indomethacin. Prostaglandins to open
- MOA: cox inhibitor

## Temporal arteritis

- headache, jaw pain, eye pain, temporal artery pain
- steroids first, then biopsy

## Atypical Lung

- aspergillosis: **halo** sign with pulmonary nodules, hemoptysis, dense consolidation on CXR
- histoplasmosis
- blastomycosis
- Coccidiomycosis

# Practice Questions

- focal nodular hyperplasia: CT liver lesion with central scar
- choledochal cyst: cystic dilation of bile duct. Surgical excision
- pancreatic cystadenoma: premalignant. Distal pancreatectomy
- 12 yo fall. PE is good. Xray c spine next.
- low dose heparin or lovenox for DVT prior to surgery
- penile cancer
- Melanoma: wide local exision. Cut off fingers
- needle localized open biopsy or stereotactic if no lump palpable for breast cancer. FNA if palpable mass
- compartment syndrome: passive movement of the great toe
