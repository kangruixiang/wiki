This patient's symptoms are concerning for **major depressive disorder** (depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbance, poor appetite, impaired concentration, tearfulness, guilt). All patients should be screened for postpartum depression at the postpartum visit. **==Postpartum depression==** is diagnosed using the **same diagnostic criteria** used to diagnose a **major depressive episode** (>2 weeks of at least 5 of 9 symptoms that include depressed mood plus SIGECAPS: **S**leep disturbance, loss of **I**nterest, **G**uilt, low **E**nergy, impaired **C**oncentration, change in **A**ppetite, **P**sychomotor retardation or agitation, and **S**uicidal thoughts). A screening instrument such as Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale can also be used to assess which women require a more thorough evaluation.

==Postpartum blues== is a self-limited condition consisting of milder depressive symptoms with less impact on functioning. It typically peaks at 5 days postpartum and resolves within 2 weeks. By contrast, this patient's depressive symptoms have persisted beyond 2 weeks and appear to be worsening.

==Adjustment disorder== is diagnosed only if symptoms do not meet the criteria for another specific disorder such as major depressive disorder.
