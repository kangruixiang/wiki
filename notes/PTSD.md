Post-traumatic stress disorder is a stress response to a generally catastrophic experience, which is **life threatening or otherwise traumatic**.

- Exposure to actual or threatened trauma
- Intrusive memories, nightmares, flashbacks with intense psychological/physiological reactions
- **Amnesia** for event, detachment, **avoidance of reminders**
- Negative mood
- Arousal with sleep disturbance, irritability, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, impaired concentration

Post-traumatic stress disorder must last for **> 1 month** to be diagnosed. Until then, symptoms of PTSD can be diagnosed as **acute stress disorder**.
