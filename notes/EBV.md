**Epstein-Barr virus** (EBV) is the most common causative  agent of IM and is transmitted via contact with oropharyngeal  secretions. The diagnostic test of choice in confirming EBV IM is the **heterophile antibody test**, which screens for IgM antibodies called heterophile antibodies. These  antibodies are produced in response to EBV infection and agglutinate  with erythrocytes from unrelated species (eg, horse erythrocytes in the  Monospot test, sheep erythrocytes in the classic Paul-Bunnell test).  Atypical lymphocytes are often seen on peripheral blood smears but are  not specific for IM.

**Corticosteroids** are warranted in the treatment of infectious mononucleosis (IM) in rare cases when **airway obstruction** appears imminent; common warning signs include shortness of breath  while recumbent, tachypnea, and inability to swallow. Corticosteroids  may also be considered in patients with IM who are immunocompromised or  are experiencing other serious complications (eg, aplastic anemia,  overwhelming infection, thrombocytopenia).

<!-- mono vs HIV vs strep -->

Primary HIV infection should be suspected in a sexually active  individual with unexplained fever, fatigue, weight loss, and  lymphadenopathy. However, **exudative pharyngitis is not seen in HIV  infection**, whereas symptoms such as diarrhea and rash usually are.

Although this patient meets some of the Centor criteria (ie, fever,  exudative pharyngitis, lack of cough), streptococcal pharyngitis is  unlikely in a patient with generalized **lymphadenopathy** and **hepatosplenomegaly**.
