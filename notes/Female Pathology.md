## HPV

<!-- HPV types and Diseases -->

![](http://i.imgur.com/XyFISGb.jpg)

<!-- HPV location and neoplasia names -->

| Location | Neoplasia                               |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Vulvar   | VIN, vulvular intraepithelial neoplasia |
| Vagina   | VAIN, vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia |
| Cervix   | CIN, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia |

### Vaccine

<!-- HPV Vaccines -->

- Gardasil (HPV 6, 11, 16, 18): vaccine against HPV, is now FDA approved for both males and females.
- Cervarix (HPV 16, 18): protect against CIN and carcinoma
- anti HPV 6 and 11: protect against condylomas

## Pap Smear

<!-- Screening tool for squamous dysplasia and cancer -->

Pap Smear: gold standard **screening test** used for the detection of squamous dysplasia and cancer. It can also be used as a tool to evaluate hormone status.

<!-- When is first and subsequent Pap smear performed -->

Screening begins at age **21** and is initially performed every **3 years**.

<!-- Pap smear location -->

In order to be considered an adequate sample, it must contain sampling from the **squamocolumnar junction (transformation zone) cells**. This would include both metaplastic squamous cells and mucus-secreting columnar cells.

<!-- Abnormal pap smear histology -->

**Abnormal Pap smear** findings include dysplasia or carcinoma in situ (CIS), both of which are characterized by the following findings on histology:

- **Koilocytic atypia**
- **Nuclear enlargement** ("raisinoid" appearance)
- **Nuclear hyperchromasia**
- **Coarse chromatin granules**
- **Perinuclear halo**

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SGcpyeW.jpg)
Pap smears.
A‚ Normal. Large‚ flat cells with small nuclei.
B‚ Dysplasia. Large‚ dark nuclei indicate damaged DNA; cytoplasmic halo indicates human papillomavirus (HPV) effect.
C‚ Malignant. Compact cells with huge‚ irregular‚ dark nuclei indicate malignancy.

![](http://i.imgur.com/BnKfRim.jpg)
Normal (left) and abnormal pap smear. Normal: small nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, pink color.

Abnormal pap smear is followed with colposcopy and biopsy.

<!-- Limitation of pap smear -->

Pap smear has limited efficacy in screening for adenocarcinoma (does not have stages)

## Vulvar SCC

<!-- rare Vulvar pathology -->

Relatively **rare**, malignant carcinoma arising from the **squamous epithelium** of the vulva.

<!-- Vulvar carcinoma gross appearance -->

The lesions commonly present as **leukoplakia**
![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/sX8y1pE.jpg)

<!-- Vulvar carcinoma diagnosis -->

**Biopsy** may be required to distinguish vulvar carcinoma from other causes of leukoplakia (lichen problems).

<!-- Vulvar carcinoma causes -->

The etiology may be HPV-related (**associated with “high-risk” types 16 and 18**) or non-HPV related.

<!-- HPV tumor proteins -->

HPV 16 and 18 makes **E6 and E7** that increases destruction of **p53 and Rb**. Loss of these tumor suppressor proteins increase risk for VAIN, CIN , VIN

<!-- HPV vulvar carcinoma risk and demographics -->

HPV related vulvar carcinoma (VIN, Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia) risk factors related to HPV exposure, multiple partners, early intercourse. Women of reproductive age, 40-50s (get around 25-30, takes 15 years to develop)

### Non-HPV vulvar carcinoma

<!-- non-HPV vulvar carcinoma cause and demographics -->

Often arise from **long-standing lichen sclerosis**, which are generally seen in elderly women (average age is >70 years old).

## Vaginal SCC

<!-- SCC of vagina characteristics, cause -->

Carcinoma arising from the squamous epithelium lining the vaginal mucosa.

- They most commonly develop from the **extension of a squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.**
- In general, primary squamous cell carcinomas of the vagina are rare
- There is a high association with "high-risk" HPV 16 and 18 serotypes
- Precursor lesion is vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN)

<!-- SCC of vagina lymph spread -->

The route of lymph node metastasis differs based on the location of the primary tumor:

- Upper ⅓ of vagina drains to **iliac nodes**
- Lower ⅔ vagina drains to \*\*inguinal nodes \*\*

The distinct routes of lymphatic drainage correspond to the embryologic origin of different parts of the the vagina; recall that the upper ⅓ of the vagina is derived from the paramesonephric duct, while the lower ⅔ of the vagina is derived from the urogenital sinus.

## CIN and Cervical Carcinoma

### CIN

<!-- CIN causes and pathogenesis -->

Pathogenesis:

- Strongly associated with "high-risk" **HPV 16, 18, 31, & 33**
- HPV infects immature basal cells of the squamous epithelium and immature metaplastic squamous cells at the **squamocolumnar junction**. Infection usually eradicated by immune system in acute inflammation. Persistent infection leads to risk for CIN and then carcinoma

<!-- CIN histology -->

\*\*Koilocytes \*\*(seen in all HPV related diseases) are seen beginning at the basal layer and extending outward. These are cells with a clear halo surrounding hyperchromatic, atypical nuclei. Increased mitotic activity.

<!-- Classification of CIN -->

Classification of CIN:

- **CIN 1**: dysplasia involving lower 1/3 of the epithelium
- **CIN 2**: dysplasia involving lower 2/3 of the epithelium
- **CIN 3**: dysplasia involving slightly less than the entire thickness of the epithelium
- **CIS** (Carcinoma in situ): dysplasia involving the entire thickness of the epithelium.

High grade dysplasia (carcinoma in situ) in the uterine cervix. The abnormal epithelium is extending into a mucus gland to the left of centre. This disease can progress to invasive cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) of the cervix:
![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/4P94OPE.jpg)
CIN III
![](http://i.imgur.com/cVXlKC0.jpg)
Development of dysplasia and carcinoma of the cervix. Repeated human papillomavirus (HPV) infections convert normal epithelium (left) into increasingly severe dysplasia until malignant epithelium breaks through the basement membrane to become invasive cancer‚ capable of metastasis by invasion of blood vessels and lymphatics.
![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/5iWQU5X.jpg)

<!-- Prognosis of CIN -->

CIN I to III can regress. **CIS cannot regress** and will proceed to invasive squamous cell carcinoma once it breaks through basement membrane.

<!-- What is CIS, carcinoma in situ -->

**Carcinoma in situ** is characterized by **atypical changes extending through the entire thickness of the epithelium**.

- As it has not yet invaded the basement membrane, it is considered a **precancerous** lesion.

### Invasive cervical carcinoma

<!-- Two types of cervical carcinoma and causes -->

Two subtypes of cervical carcinoma are **SCC** (80%) and **adenocarcinoma** (columnar cells). Both types are related to **HPV**.

<!-- Cervical carcinoma risk factors -->

(Cervical carcinoma risk factors)Risk factors for cervical carcinoma are:

- **Multiple sexual partners (#1 risk factor)**
- Immunodeficiency (AIDS defining illness): Immune systems fail to destroy HPV
- Early sexual intercourse
- Birth control pills
- Smoking

<!-- Female reproductive AIDS defining illness -->

Cervical carcinoma is AIDS defining illness

<!-- Cervical carcinoma symptoms -->

Cervical cancer is now the least common gynecologic cancer due to the success of the Pap smear screening tests. It typically presents with **foul smelling discharge and irregular bleeding, which is often postcoital.**

<!-- How does cervical carcinoma migrate -->

Advanced tumors invade **locally** through anterior uterine wall into the bladder, blocking the ureters. Hydronephrosis with postrenal failure is a common cause of death in advanced cervical carcinoma.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/kWf2BBh.jpg)

<!-- Screening test for cervical dysplasia -->

**Pap smear is the screening test of choice** because it can discover cervical dysplasia before it progresses to invasive carcinoma. Dysplastic cells demonstrate koilocytosis (cellular changes in which cells appear to have halo nuclei on cytologic examination).

# Vulva Pathology

## Anatomy

<!-- What is vulva and type of epithelium -->

- skin and mucosa of female genitalia external to hymen
- lined by **squamous epithelium**

## Bartholin Cysts

<!-- Bartholin cysts definition -->

Cystic dilation of Bartholin glands, happens in women of **reproductive age** due to infection and STI
![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/X48xhuE.jpg)

<!-- Bartholin gland function -->

Bartholin gland produce mucus-like fluid via ducts into lower vestibule.

<!-- Bartholin cyst cause -->

Bartholin cysts typically arise due to **inflammation and obstruction of the gland**

<!-- Bartholin cysts symptoms -->

Bartholin cysts commonly present with a \*\*unilateral, painful cystic lesion at the lower vestibule adjacent to the vaginal canal. \*\*

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/qR9ZzFJ.jpg)

## Lichen Simplex Chronicus

<!-- Lichen Simplex Chronicus pathology -->

Lichen Simplex Chronicus is a benign lesion characterized by **hyperplasia of the vulvar squamous epithelium**.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/BLFi17j.jpg)

<!-- Lichen Simplex Chronicus gross -->

The lesions of lichen simplex chronicus commonly present as **leukoplakia with thick, leathery vulvar skin**. 
![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/bB4zbXm.jpg)

<!-- Lichen Simplex Chronicus cause -->

The development of lichen simplex chronicus is associated with **chronic irritation** and **scratching of the vulva**.

<!-- Lichen Simplex Chronicus result -->

Lichen Simplex Chronicus \*\*does not carry an increased risk \*\*of squamous cell carcinoma.

## Condyloma

<!-- Two types of condyloma, causes, transmission, and histology -->

Condyloma is a **sexually transmitted** lesion that can be caused by either **HPV 6, 11 (condyloma accuminatum) or secondary syphilis (condyloma latum)**. These lesions can be differentiated by the following:

- Condyloma accuminatum: warty growth on the external genitals **(vulva, vaginal canal, cervix)** or at the anus, consisting of fibrous overgrowths covered by thickened epithelium showing koilocytosis.
- Condyloma latum: **Less common.** eruption of flat-topped papules, found at the anus and wherever contiguous folds of skin produce heat and moisture.

![](http://i.imgur.com/JcL7j0u.jpg)
condyloma accuminatum:
![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/HcclGnr.jpg)

<!-- Condyloma progression to carcinoma? -->

Condylomas **rarely progress to carcinoma,** and this is because HPV types 6 and 11 are considered “low-risk.”

<!-- HPV condyloma histology -->

Histologically, condylomas associated with HPV are characterized by **koilocytes with “raisin-like” nuclei surrounded by a halo**.

Low mag: warts like
![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/e4jFyGh.jpg)

High mag: koilocytes, raisin like nucleus
![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/CxmFGuh.jpg)

## Extramammary Paget Disease

<!-- Extramammary paget disease location and histology -->

Extramammary Paget Disease is characterized by **malignant epithelial cells with pale cytoplasm and eccentric, hyperchromatic nuclei** (Paget cells) in the **epidermis** of the vulva.

Extramammary disease, malignant paget cells infiltrating dermis. Epithelial near top. Looks like melanoma.
![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/86Klhzw.jpg)

<!-- What do lesions of extramammary paget disease look like? -->

The lesions of extramammary paget disease commonly present as **erythematous, pruritic, ulcerated vulvar skin**. 
![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/VqX1Ix7.jpg)

<!-- Difference between extramammary paget disease and carcinoma in situ -->

Extramammary Paget disease represents carcinoma in situ (CIS), however, unlike paget disease of the nipple (breast involvement), **there is usually no underlying carcinoma**.

<!-- Difference between extramammary paget disease and melanoma -->

It is very **important to distinguish extramammary paget disease from melanoma**, which is a lesion that rarely occurs on the vulva. The following histologic staining is used to make the differentiation:

Paget cells: **PAS positive, keratin positive, S100 negative** (Pas: mucous secretion from epithelial cells)

Melanoma: **PAS negative, keratin negative, S100 positive**

# Vagina Pathology

## Anatomy

<!-- Vagina mucosa epithelium -->

- stratified, non-keratinized squamous epithelium

## Adenosis

<!-- How does DES exposure affect daughter and son -->

![](http://i.imgur.com/J6Yp6Dc.jpg)

<!-- Adenosis of vagina is -->

**Focal persistence of columnar epithelium in the upper vagina.**

During development, squamous epithelium from lower 1/3 (urogenital sinus) of the vagina grows upward to replace columnar epithelium lining of upper 2/3 of vagina (mullerian ducts)
![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/2xkwM1K.jpg)

<!-- Adenosis of vagina risk -->

**In utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES)** is a major risk factor for adenosis of the vagina.

Adenosis of vagina:

## Clear Cell Adenocarcinoma

<!-- Adenosis of vagina association -->

**Clear Cell Adenocarcinoma** of the vagina is a rare, malignant tumor of glands with clear cytoplasm that is a complication associated with diethylstilbestrol-associated vaginal adenosis. It is commonly associated with exposure to DES in utero (Estrogen crosses placenta, distrupting development of squamous epithelium)

<!-- Clear cell adenocarcinoma histology -->

When viewed microscopically, the tissue demonstrates cells with hyperchromatic nuclei (also known as "Hobnail" nuclei) protruding into the gland lumen.

## Sarcoma Botryoides

<!-- Sarcoma botryoides is -->

A **malignant mesenchymal proliferation of immature skeletal muscle**. This is a rare variant of rhabdomyosarcoma.

<!-- Sarcoma botryoides -->

Aka Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma

<!-- Sarcoma botryoides demographics -->

Most commonly seen in **girls and boys younger than age 4.**

<!-- Sarcoma botryoides gross -->

Grossly, it presents as **multiple polypoid masses resembling a "bunch of grapes" projecting out of the vagina**, and will often be seen protruding from the vulva; clear/yellow in color. In young boys it will be seen protruding from the penis.

Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (sarcoma botryoides) of vagina. The grape-like tumor protrudes through the introitus:

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/MDPfjwX.jpg)

<!-- Sarcoma botroides histology -->

Microscopic observation of Sarcoma Botryoides reveals \*\*striated, spindle shaped tumor cells known as rhabdomyoblasts \*\*(immature muscle cells). Has cytoplasmic cross-striations like skeletal muscle cells
![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/GlFMC2K.jpg)

<!-- Sarcoma botroides stain -->

Stains positive for **desmin** (intermediate filaments in muscle cells) and **myogenin** (transcription factor only found in immature muscle cells).

# Cervix Pathology

## Anatomy

- \[_]\(Cervix normal histology)Neck of uterus
- Divided into endocervix and exocervix
	- Exocervix: nonkeratinized squamous epithelium
	- Endocervix: columnar cells
	- Junction: transformation zone
    ![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/Oe39QbL.jpg)
    Most cervical pathology stems from the effects of sexually transmitted infections.

## Cervicitis

<!-- Cervicitis definition and causes -->

is condition that involves inflammation of the cervix that typically occurs in the transformation zone. Most commonly (>50%) caused by **ascending infections** from \*\*Chlamydia \*\*or **Gonorrhea**

Other common causes cervicitis include:

- **Trichomonas vaginalis**: foul smelling, frothy, yellow/green discharge
- **Candida albicans**: white, chunky, cottage cheese discharge
- **Gardnerella vaginalis** (Bacterial vaginosis): foul smelling, fishy, grey discharge
- **HSV-2**
- **HPV**

<!-- Acute cervicitis symptoms and results -->

**Acute cervicitis**

- Presents with **vaginal discharge, bleeding, pain, dyspareunia** (pain with intercourse)
- If untreated it can progress to **chronic cervicitis**, which carries an increased risk for **infertility**

<!-- Follicular cervicitis cause, histology -->

**Follicular cervicitis**

- Subtype of cervicitis caused by **Chlamydia trachomatis**
- Histologically, it is characterized by lymphoid germinal centers and vacuoles containing reticulate bodies.
- \[_]\(follicular cervicitis is)Common cause of neonatal conjunctivitis and pneumonia

# Uterine Pathology

## Anatomy

<!-- Difference between endometrium and myometrium -->

- Endometrium: mucosal lining of uterine cavity
- Myometrium: smooth muscle underneath
  ![](http://i.imgur.com/TQTL2wY.jpg)
  Left: endometrium. Right: myometrum
- Endometerium is hormone sensitive. Estrogen: growth. Progesterone: preparation. Menstruation: shedding

## Endometritis

<!-- Endometritis is -->

**Endometritis** is infection of the endometrium. It is the most common **genital tract infection** following delivery or abortion, especially in preterm deliveries. It is most often caused by bacterial infection of the endometrium.

<!-- Acute endometritis causes -->

**Acute (early-onset) Endometritis** is caused by a bacterial infection (e.g. GBS (Group B Strep), Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Ureaplasma) of the endometrium. 
Usually due to retained products of conception (after delivery or miscarriage) that act as a nidus for infection.

<!-- Acute endometritis symptoms -->

Presents as fever, abnormal uterine bleeding, and pelvic pain.

<!-- Acute endometritis hisotlogy -->

Biopsy of the endometrium will reveal **neutrophils within the endometrial glands**.

![](http://i.imgur.com/R77rZFA.jpg)
Acute endometritis

<!-- Chronic endometritis causes -->

**Chronic (late-onset) Endometritis** is caused by chronic inflammation of the endometrium. 
Causes include retained products of conception, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (e.g. _Chlamydia_), IUD (e.g. _Actinomyces israelii_), and TB.

<!-- Chronic endometritis histology -->

Biopsy of the endometrium will reveal **lymphocytes and plasma cells seen within endometrial stroma**. Also, granulomas will be seen in the case of TB infection. **Plasma cells** are necessary for the diagnosis of _chronic_ endometritis given that lymphocytes are normally found in the endometrium. 
![](http://i.imgur.com/bk5T3Ww.jpg)
Chronic endometritis

<!-- Chronic endometritis symptoms -->

Presents as abnormal uterine bleeding, pain, and infertility.

## Endometriosis 

<!-- Endometriosis is -->

**Endometriosis** is the ectopic implantation and proliferation of **endometrial glands and stromal tissue outside of the uterine endometrial lining**.

<!-- Endometriosis cause theories -->

- **Regurgitation Theory**: menstrual flow backs up through the fallopian tubes, with subsequent implantation of endometrial tissue in the peritoneum. (Retrograde flow commonly occurs in normal women)
- **Vascular/Lymphatic Dissemination**: endometrial cells enter vascular/lymphatic system, which allows deposition in distant sites.
- **Metaplastic Theory:** endometrial tissue arises from endometrial differentiation of coelomic epithelium.

<!-- Endometriosis demographics and symptoms -->

The most common clinical presentation of endometriosis is a woman in her 20s or 30s that presents with infertility and the **three D's:**

- **Dysmenorrhea** (painful menses)
- **Dyspareunia** (painful sexual intercourse)
- **Dyschezia** (painful defecation)

Cyclic bleeding and symptoms correspond to hormonal status, and because these lesions are hormonally responsive the symptoms may worsen leading up to menstruation.

- \*\*Ovaries \*\*(most common location, increased cancer risks): may produce a "chocolate cyst"
- Uterine ligaments: may produce pelvic pain
- Rectouterine pouch of Douglas: may produce dyschezia
- Bowel serosa: may produce abdominal pain and adhesions
- Bladder wall: may produce pain with urination
- Fallopian tube mucosa: scarring increases risk for ectopic tubal pregnancy

<!-- Chocolate cysts pathogenesis -->

\*\*Chocolate Cysts \*\*(also known as an endometrioma) manifest when **endometriosis is occurring in the ovaries**, and with monthly hemorrhage it leads to the creation of a blood-containing cyst.

Chocolate cysts \*\*vary with the menstrual cycle because they contain estrogen responsive endometrial tissue. \*\*

<!-- endometriosis gross -->

The menstrual-type bleeding of the ectopic endometrium most commonly occurs in the ovary, and this forms blood-filled "**chocolate cysts**" and reddish-bluish-brown "**powder-burn" serosal nodules**. 
![](http://i.imgur.com/tMoOMud.jpg)

![](http://i.imgur.com/EYaM6aX.jpg)
Powder burn serosal nodules

<!-- Endometriosis firstline treatment -->

The first-line treatment for women with mild/moderate pain caused by endometriosis is **NSAIDs plus combined(estrogen and progestin) oral contraceptives** (OCPs). An alternative to combined OCPs is progestin-only hormonal therapy (e.g. medroxyprogesterone).

<!-- Danazol is -->

**Danazol** is a synthetic androgen that acts to inhibit FSH and LH production by the anterior pituitary (negative feedback). It is FDA-approved to treat women with endometriosis-related pain; however, it is rarely used due to its adverse effects (hirsutism, acne, hepatotoxicity, etc.)

<!-- Refractory endometriosis treatment -->

Women with severe/refractory symptoms due to endometriosis can be treated with **GnRH agonists** such as **leuprolide**.

Women with endometriosis that fail medical therapy are candidates for **laparoscopic excision** of the endometriosis lesions.

## Adenomyosis

<!-- Adenomyosis, symptoms -->

Adenomyosis refers to the **presence of endometrial glands and/or stroma within the uterine myometrium**.

Adenomyosis will commonly present with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea. Patients with adenomyosis will have a **symmetrically enlarged “boggy” uterus** found on bimanual exam. The diagnosis of adenomyosis is made with biopsy, and the definitive treatment is with hysterectomy.

A boggy uterus is a finding upon physical examination where the uterus is more flaccid than would be expected.

## Endometrial hyperplasia

<!-- Endometrial hyperplasia, causes -->

**Endometrial hyperplasia** is the abnormal proliferation of endometrial glands relative to stroma; usually caused by **excess unopposed estrogen** stimulation (obesity, PCOS, estrogen replacement)
![](http://i.imgur.com/DoBmBd1.jpg)
![](http://i.imgur.com/NZ17EjJ.jpg)
![](http://i.imgur.com/YrPvOWr.jpg)

<!-- Endometrial hyperplasia risks -->

The risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia are related to **increased exposure of unopposed estrogen**:

- Early menarche; late menopause
- Nulliparity
- Anovulatory cycles
- PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome)
- Obesity (increased conversion of androgens into estrone and estradiol by aromatase within adipocytes)
- Estrogen-secreting tumors (e.g. granulosa cell tumors)
- Tamoxifen (partial agonist of estrogen receptors in endometrial tissue)
- Use of unopposed estrogen without progesterone in hormone replacement therapy

<!-- Endometrial hyperplasia symptoms -->

Endometrial hyperplasia usually presents as **postmenopausal vaginal bleeding.**

<!-- Endometrial hyperplasia classification and result -->

Classified histologically based on architectural growth pattern (simple or complex) and the presence or absence of cellular atypia. **The most important predictor for progression to carcinoma is the presence of nuclear atypia**.

Endometrial hyperplasia is a precursor to endometrial carcinoma, thus patients with endometrial hyperplasia are at \*\*\ increased risk of developing endometrial carcinoma. \*\*

## Endometrial carcinoma

<!-- Endometrial carcinoma -->

**Endometrial carcinoma** is a malignant proliferation of **endometrial glands** (adenocarcinoma).
![](http://i.imgur.com/4nMKiGG.jpg)
![](http://i.imgur.com/xtoYtGj.jpg)

<!-- Endometrial carcinoma -->

**Most common invasive carcinoma** of the female genital tract.

<!-- Endometrial carcinoma demographics and symptoms -->

Endometrial carcinoma most commonly presents in patients between **ages 60 and 70**, and classically presents with **post-menopausal vaginal bleeding**.

<!-- Endometrial carcinoma, two pathways and histology -->

There are two distinct pathways that lead to the development of endometrial carcinoma:

- **Endometrial hyperplasia pathway** (75% of cases): patient with unopposed estrogen develops endometrial hyperplasia, which eventually advances to carcinoma. Average age is 60 years. Histology is endometrioid (normal endometrium-like).  It is commonly driven by a PTEN mutation.
- **Sporadic pathway** (25% of cases): carcinoma arises in an atrophic endometrium. There is no evident precursor lesion. Average age is 70 years. Histology is usually serous and is characterized by papillary structures with psammoma body formation. It is commonly driven by a p53 mutation, and the tumor exhibits aggressive behavior. (Necrosis > calcification > psamomma body)
  ![](http://i.imgur.com/lyD0B13.jpg)
  Endometrioid. Looks like endometrium but disorganized with minimum stroma
  ![](http://i.imgur.com/QMZUht3.jpg)
  ![](http://i.imgur.com/NjIgLue.jpg)
  Sporadic pathway. Serous.

<!-- Endometrial carcinoma risks -->

The risk factors for endometrial carcinoma include:

- \*\*Prolonged unopposed estrogen exposure \*\*(refer to endometrial hyperplasia section for examples)
- ​
- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC)

<!-- Endometrial carcinoma progression and treatment -->

The prognosis of endometrial carcinoma correlates with **degree of myometrial invasion** (the deeper it invades, the worse the prognosis). 
Think of its progression as an uncontrolled proliferative (follicular) phase of menstrual cycle:
Normal endometrium transforms into simple hyperplasia, which transforms into complex hyperplasia, then atypical hyperplasia, and finally results in endometrial adenocarcinoma.

- **Simple hyperplasia**: OCPs (oral contraceptive pills)
- **Atypical hyperplasia**: hysterectomy
- **Invasive carcinoma**: some combo of surgery/chemo/radiation

## Leiomyoma

<!-- Leiomyoma is -->

(Fibroid) is a **benign proliferation of myometrial smooth muscle cells**

<!-- Leiomyoma gross -->

It often presents with multiple discrete tumors that are well-demarcated (i.e. encapsulated) by a pseudocapsule. **No necrosis or hemorrhage**
Uterine cavity in middle:
![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/Ajbx6jc.jpg)

<!-- Leiomyoma histology -->

Whorled patterns of smooth muscles on microscopic exam

<!-- Fibroids -->

Most common benign tumors in women.

<!-- Leiomyoma demographics -->

The peak occurrence is seen in **African American women** between \*\*20 and 40 years of age. \*\* (Premenopausal women because responsive to estrogen)

<!-- Leiomyoma symptoms -->

**Abnormal uterine bleeding** (e.g. menorrhagia, postcoital spotting), which is by far the most common symptom → chronic iron deficiency anemia (dizziness, weakness, fatigue) if the bleeding is severe. Due to impringe on pelvic structures. **No pain**

- **Secondary dysmenorrhea**, especially if menorrhagia is present
- **Compression of surrounding structures**, depending on the number and location of the fibroids. For example:
	- Constipation if the bowel is compressed
	- Hydronephrosis if one or both of the ureters are compressedVenous stasis if the inferior vena cava is compressed
	- **Infertility**, however the overwhelming majority of women with fibroids can conceive without difficulty

<!-- Leiomyoma result -->

Fibroids are **hormonally responsive to estrogen** (and to progesterone), and as a result they may:

- **Increase in size during pregnancy** or when exposed to high levels of exogenous or endogenous estrogen
- Stop growing or even decrease in size during/following menopause

Leiomyomas **do not progress** to a leiomyosarcoma.

There is recent evidence that leiomyomas may also produce EPO (which can potentially cause erythrocytosis).

<!-- Leiomyoma treatment -->

Treatment:

- \*\*Hysterectomy \*\*
- Myotomy for women who wish to preserve fertility

## Leiomyosarcoma

<!-- Leiomyosarcoma, cause -->

**Leiomyosarcoma** is a malignant proliferation of smooth muscle arising from the myometrium that **typically arises de novo** (they do NOT arise from a leiomyoma).

<!-- Leiomyosarcoma demographics -->

Leiomyosarcomas have an increased incidence in **African Americans**. Often in **postmenopausal women**.

<!-- Leiomyosarcoma symptoms -->

Leiomyosarcomas are a highly aggressive tumor with a tendency to recur. They commonly present as a **bleeding mass fungating from the myometrium into the lumen of the uterus**, sometimes even protruding through the cervix.

<!-- Leiomyosarcoma gross -->

Grossly, leiomyosarcomas appear as bulky irregularly shaped tumors with areas of **necrosis and hemorrhage**. Histological features include necrosis, mitotic activity, and cellular atypia. (single lesion)

## Asherman Syndrome

<!-- Asherman syndrome, cause, pathogenesis, result -->

Repeated dilation and curettage (D\&C) procedures that remove the **stratum basalis**, the stem cell layer of the endometrium that generates functionalis layer for growth and shedding. This renders the endometrium unable to regenerate, resulting in endometrial fibrosis and scarring. Asherman syndrome is an etiology of **secondary amenorrhea**.

## Anovolatory Cycle

<!-- Anovolatory cycle definition, result -->

**Anovulatory cycle** is a condition characterized by a lack of ovulation. It results in an **estrogen-driven proliferative phase without a subsequent progesterone-driven secretory phase**. Proliferative glands eventually break down and shed resulting in uterine bleeding. It represents a common cause of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, especially during menarche and prior to menopause.

## Endometrial polyp

<!-- Endometrial polyp,symptom, cause -->

- Hyperplastic protrusion of the endometrium.
