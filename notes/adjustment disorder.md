# Adjustment Disorder

- related: [[PTSD]], [[Psychiatry]]

## Diagnosis

Adjustment disorder includes behavioral/emotional symptoms following a stressful life event such as a divorce, death of a family member or friend, or changes in one's school or work situation. Four key differential diagnoses to rule out before diagnosing are:

- **Acute stress disorder**
- **PTSD**
- **Bereavement**
- **Major depressive disorder** (MDD)

<!-- adjustment vs PTSD vs acute stress -->

In adjustment disorder, **the life event is** **not life threatening**, a key feature that differentiates it from post-traumatic stress disorder [[PTSD]].

In adjustment disorder, the stressor can be of any severity and results in symptoms of anxiety and depression that do not meet criteria for another psychiatric disorder.  **Intrusive recollections and avoidance behavior characteristic of acute stress disorder are not present**.

Patients experiencing post-traumatic stress and functional impairment for the ==first 30 days== following a traumatic event are diagnosed as having ==acute stress disorder==, which is treated primarily with ==cognitive-behavioral therapy==.Â  Patients who remain symptomatic after 30 days are diagnosed with PTSD and may benefit from the addition of an antidepressant.

<!-- adjustment vs major depressive disorder -->

Symptoms of **anhedonia, weight loss**, or other symptoms of major depressive disorder trump dysthymic symptoms of adjustment disorder. Diagnose MDD in the presence of these.

<!-- adjustment vs bereavement -->

If the patient fits normal characteristics of bereavement, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed. This can be a very difficult distinction to make. Rule out \*\*symptoms directly related to the loved one \*\*in order to diagnose adjustment disorder. For example:

- Adjustment disorder after death of loved one: Patient exhibits anxiety/depressed mood over the added stress of funeral costs, moving, and continued care of relatives.
- Bereavement after death of loved one: Patient exhibits anxiety/depressed mood over the absence of their loved one and the associated loss of quality of life. _Their symptoms are temporally and circumstantially tied to reminders of their loved one._

<!-- physiologic vs pathological adjustment to life -->

As in most aspects of psychiatry, the line between physiological and pathological adjustment to a life stressor is defined by functional impairment. Adjustment disorder differs from a normal stress reaction by the presence of **social/occupational dysfunction.**

## Symptoms

<!-- adjustment symptoms begin and end when -->

Symptoms in adjustment disorder can range from mood disorder symptoms (e.g. depressed mood) to anxiety symptoms, and are sub-classified as such. The symptoms begin within **3 months** after the stressful life event has occurred.

Symptoms of adjustment disorder classically end within **6 months** after the event is over. _This is key in the differential diagnosis of adjustment disorder and other similar disorders._

While unlikely to be tested, adjustment disorder can be chronic in the face of a chronic, continuous stressor.

## Treatment

<!-- adjustment disorder treatment.. -->

The best treatment for adjustment disorder is **supportive psychotherapy**. Medications may be used to help improve associated symptoms, such as pharmacotherapy for insomnia.
