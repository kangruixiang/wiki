<!-- SBP definition, ppx when and which medication, rx b:868433830879-->

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is an ==infection of ascitic fluid== in the setting of portal hypertension. SBP has a high mortality rate, and patients who develop SBP should be considered for liver transplantation. SBP can present with ==fever, abdominal pain, and kidney disease==, but its presence should be considered in ==any patient with ascites who experiences a decline in condition==. Patients with ==very low total protein levels in their ascitic fluid== (<1.5 g/dL [15 g/L]) in conjunction with serum sodium level less than or equal to 130 mEq/L (130 mmol/L), serum creatinine level greater than or equal to 1.2 mg/dL (106.1 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen level greater than or equal to 25 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L), serum bilirubin level greater than or equal to 3 mg/dL (51.3 µmol/L), or Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B or C cirrhosis are at high risk for development of SBP and should be given ==long-term primary prophylaxis== with a fluoroquinolone antibiotic (for example, norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin).

The diagnosis of SBP is established by an ascitic-fluid neutrophil count of ==250/µL or higher on diagnostic paracentesis==. ==Bacterial culture== of ascitic fluid should also be obtained. Prompt initiation of therapy with a third-generation ==cephalosporin== (for example, cefotaxime) is the initial treatment of SBP. If patients have kidney dysfunction, or significant hepatic dysfunction as measured by a serum bilirubin level greater than 4 mg/dL (68 µmol/L), adjunctive therapy with ==albumin== (1.5 g/kg body weight on day 1, as well as 1 g/kg on day 3) should be administered; such treatment has a demonstrated survival benefit.

Follow-up paracentesis to demonstrate improvement in inflammation can be performed if clinical improvement is not obvious. Indefinite secondary prophylactic therapy should be offered to patients after resolution of SBP and typically consists of once-daily fluoroquinolone therapy.

## Prophylaxis

### Criterias

- total ascitic protein: <1.5 g/L
- renal dysfunction: Cr > 1.5, BUN > , Na < 130
- liver failure: child pugh C with bili >= 3

### Abx

- cipro 500 mg/day
- bactrim for pts with allergies but not much data to support primary ppx for low protein ascities

## Treatment

- rocephin, IV albumin

- repeat para if not improved

- SBP: PMN > 50
	- cover GNR and strep pneumo

- PD catheter: WBC > 100
	- cover polymicrobial: vanc + zosyn + fluconazole
