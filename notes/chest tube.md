1. Collection Chamber
   - collects fluid or air
   - air travels to second chamber
2. Water Seal Chamber
   - bubbles = air leak = air coming out of chest still
   - continuous air leak first, then intermittent air leak
   - test air leak with cough: forced exhalation
3. Suction chamber: regulates amount of suction
   - wall suction is very high pressure, -300 cmHg
   - suction chamber has tube that's open to air
   - level of submersion tube is in water determines how much pressure is suctioning

## Removing chest tube

- Air: no suction, no bubbles => clamp tubclamp tube, trial 4 hours or longer
- liquid: < 150cc/24 hours, no clamping needed
