- Population: women 25-35, 5% to 10% of all women
- pathogenesis: endometrial tissue outside the uterus (eg, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cul-de-sac, uterosacral ligaments).
- Symptoms: **dysmenorrhea**, chronic pelvic pain, **deep dyspareunia**, dyschezia, and infertility.
- Physical exam: pelvic exam shows immobile uterus, pain on lateral movement of the cervix; a fixed, uterosacral nodularity, and adnexal masses, although examination is often normal.
- treatment:
	- does not need biopsy to confirm diagnosis before starting treatment
	- 1st line: NSAIDS, **combined OCP** (decrease pain/inflammation)
	- progestin only: medroxyprogesterone acetate
	- GnRH analogs (leuprolide)
	- synthetic androgen (danazol)
	- surgical excision
	- hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy
