# acid and base in liver disease

- related: [[GI]]

<!-- liver disease patients alkalosis and acidosis causes -->

## Alkalosis

- cirrhosis pts have respiratory alkalosis
	- ascites/hydrothorax causes hyperventilation
	- hyperammonaemia and hepatic encephalopathy also cause hyperventilation
- albumin causes alkalosis
	- albumin is weak acid
	- 1g decrease in albumin causes base excess of 3

## Acidosis

- Hyponatremia is related to acidosis
	- free water pH 7.0 dilutes blood pH 7.4
	- repeat paracentesis causes increased free water retention and can exacerbate hyponatremia
- Hyperchloridemia causes acidosis
	- Cl- replaces HCO3-
	- chronic respiratory alkalosis: kidney starts excreting more HCO3 in response and decreases NH4Cl secretion
	- diarrhea
- Lactic acidosis
	- 95% metabolized by liver
	- 5% by kidney, worsened with AKI
