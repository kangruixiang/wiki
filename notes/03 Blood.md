- E-shaped flag: chylomicrons contain surface apolipoproteins A, B, C and E
- Chylomicrons deliver triglycerides from the intestines to peripheral tissues

<!-- statin includes, MOA.. -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/MKkvyw8.jpg)

- Steampunk pirate: statins (e.g. simvastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin) (most effect at liver, high first past effects)
- knocking over HMG crude ore reducer: statins inhibit HMG CoA reductase
- Statin-punk threatening workers to pull in LDL ship: statins cause increased LDL receptor expression on hepatocytes, clearing LDLs from circulation

Statins act through competitive **inhibition** of **HMG-CoA reductase**, preventing conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid (the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis).  Decreased liver cholesterol synthesis leads to increased hepatic clearance of LDL from the circulation by LDL receptors.  After mediating endocytosis of LDL particles, the LDL receptors are returned to the cell surface for reuse (receptor recycling); LDL is digested and used for metabolic purposes.  This **increase in LDL receptor recycling** allows intrahepatic cholesterol levels to remain at normal levels while blood levels are kept low.
