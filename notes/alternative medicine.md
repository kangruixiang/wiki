<!-- herbal supplements uses and side effects -->

**Saw palmetto** is a popular herbal preparation most often used by men to treat **benign prostatic hyperplasia**.  Its use **has not** been shown to significantly improve urinary symptoms or flow measures.  In addition, saw palmetto does not appear to affect prostate-specific antigen levels or prostate size.

Kava kava is an herbal preparation that may help with symptoms of anxiety and insomnia; however, its use is not recommended due to the potential risk of severe liver toxicity.

St. John's wort is frequently used in the treatment of depression; however, there is inconsistent evidence supporting its efficacy.

Hypercholesterolemia is sometimes treated with garlic preparations; however, there is limited data regarding its efficacy.  Fish oil supplementation can be effective in the treatment of refractory hypertriglyceridemia.

Osteoarthritis is often treated with glucosamine and chondroitin.  Although these agents appear to be safe, studies demonstrating their clinical benefit are limited.
