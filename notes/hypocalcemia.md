## Causes

- hyperphosphatemia: check ionized Ca.
- IV bicarb can cause hypocalcemia and deposition of calcium phosphate in renal tubules
-

## Symptoms

- mild: muscle cramps, tingling sensations
- severe: seizure

## Treatment

- Usually do not need repletion unless ionized < 1.0. For hyperphosphatemia, repleting Ca can cause Ca-phos deposition and calciphylaxis.

### Minor

- oral calcium: calcium citrate or carbonate, aka tums
- Calcitriol: activated vitamin D, necessary for Ca absorption

### Severe

- symptomatic, prolonged QTc, Ca < 7.5
- IV calcium gluconate bolus followed by infusion
- 10 g in 1L NS over 24 hours
- start PO at same time
- typically ordered by endocrine consult
