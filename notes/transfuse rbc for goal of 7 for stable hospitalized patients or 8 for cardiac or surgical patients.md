For stable, nonbleeding, hospitalized patients, transfusion goal should be 7. For stable, nonbleeding, hospitalized patients who have preexisting coronary artery disease or are undergoing surgery, transfusion goal should be 8 or if patient is symptomatic (chest pain, tachycardia, hypotension). No transfusion goal is set for patients with active ACS.
