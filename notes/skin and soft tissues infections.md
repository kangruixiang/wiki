# Skin and Soft Tissues

## Introductions

Types of skin infections:

- Purulent: usually staph
	- abscess
	- furuncles
	- carbuncles
- Nonpurulent: usually beta-hemolytic strep
	- erysipelas
	- cellulitis
	- necrotizing skin infections

## Erysipelas and Cellulitis

- Erysipelas: epidermis, upper dermis, superficial lymphatics
- Cellulitis: deeper dermis, subcutaneous fat tissues

Differential diagnosis:

- contact or stasis dermatitis
- lymphadema
- erythema nodosum
- DVT
- thrombophlebitis
- lipodermatosclerosis
- erythromelalgia
- hypersensitivity reactions

Diagnosis

- Blood cultures: positive 5%. Not routinely used
- Skin aspirate/biopsy: consider
- Imaging: not helpful but can use to exclude necrotizing infection

Treatment

- Surgical debridement: necrotizing infection, bullae, desquamation
- Duration: 5 days and extend as necessary until improvement
- Ppx: Consider penicillin or erythromycin for patients with >3 episodes annually

- Stasis dermatitis
	- Stasis dermatitis is caused by fluid buildup due to varicose veins, circulation issues, or heart disease.
	- Skin discoloration of the ankles or shins, itching, thickened skin, and open sores (ulcers) are symptoms.
	- Treatments may include compression stockings and prescription creams as well as treating the underlying condition.

## Necrotizing Fasciitis

- subdermal compartments: fascia, muscle
- usually spreads along superficial fascia
- usually occur with previous skin trauma/infection, extremities more often
- risk factors: DM, IVDU, malignancy, liver disease, immunocompromised
	- liver disease: V. vulnificus especially
	- DM: NF of perineum, Fournier gangrene
- bacteria: _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Streptococcus agalactiae, Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio vulnificus,_ and _Clostridium perfringens._
- LRINEC score for risk indicator

Bullous cellulitis characteristic of _Vibrio vulnificus_  infection is shown in a patient with cirrhosis; cutaneous necrosis is  also evident, most likely associated with disseminated intravascular  coagulation.

- Sx:
	- initially resembles cellulitis
	- rapid progression with edema, severe pain, bullous lesion, skin necrosis, crepitus, anesthesia
	- SIRS
	- characteristics: "woody" induration with palpation

- Labs: nonspecific

- Imaging:
	- gas in soft tissues
	- MRI > xray/CT

- Treatment
	- empiric: aerobic and anaerobic organisms (including MRSA) and consists of vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid plus piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, or a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole. Some experts also recommend adding empiric clindamycin because of its suppression of toxin production by staphylococci and streptococci.
	- Antimicrobial discontinuation can be considered when the patient is  afebrile and clinically stable, and surgical debridement is no longer  required.

## Purulent Skin Infections

- Abscess: pus collection in dermis, subcutaneous fat
- Furuncles: boils. Hair follicle associated abscess into dermis/subcutaneous tissues
- Carbuncle: extension subcutaneously with several furuncles
- Treatment
	- I\&D
	- Gram stain and culture with drainage
	- MRSA: decolonization with topical intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine washes
