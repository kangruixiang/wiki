# Dissociative Disorders

<!-- depersonalization treatment.. -->

**Depersonalization disorder** is characterized by feelings of detachment from oneself or oneâ€™s environment. Transient depersonalization may occur during periods of severe stress, but this disorder is defined by persistent depersonalization that causes social/occupational distress.

Treatment is **symptomatic** for associated depression (SSRIs) and anxiety (SSRIs, benzodiazepines, etc.).

<!-- dissociative amnesia vs fugue vs dissociative identity disorder. Treatment.. -->

**Dissociative amnesia** is an inability to recall memories due to psychiatric dissociation, usually surrounding a stressful event. The classic description is a patient who has completely intact memory except amnesia of a traumatic rape experience.

**Dissociative fugue** is characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity associated with unplanned travel or wandering, usually occuring in stressful situations such as **war or personal losses**. The classic example is a patient who wakes up in an unfamiliar place with no recollection of who they are or how they got there.

_Note: As of DSM-5, dissociative fugue is a subtype of dissociative amnesia, not a separate diagnosis._

After recovery from fugue, previous memories **usually return intact**; however, during the fugue episode, there is complete amnesia.

**Dissociative identity disorder** (multiple personality disorder) is defined by 2 or more distinct personalities within a single patient. The classic description is a patient who receives photos of his/herself doing things the patient doesn't remember, with people the patient doesn't know.

Most patients have experienced prior trauma, especially **child abuse**.

**Dissociative identity disorder** has the worst prognosis of all dissociative disorders.

Treatment of all dissociative disorders involves **psychotherapy**. Sodium amobarbital or lorazepam may help patients talk more freely in an interview.
