Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome is a condition that affects roughly 5% of women of reproductive age, and is characterized by the formation of **multiple ovarian follicular cysts due to hormone imbalance**.

### Pathogenesis

The pathogenesis of polycystic ovarian syndrome in general is poorly understood, however the following is the current understanding:

- Caused by genetics + diet and obesity
- High GnRN => LH => androgen synthesis by theca cells => increased aromatization to estrone in peripheral adipose tissue => negative feedback to FSH => low FSH = cystic degeneration of follicle
	- **insensitivity to progesterone leading to increased LH**
- Result: secondary amenorrhea and anovulation 
- **insulin resistance**
	- Insulin => theca secretion of androgen and inhibition of sex-hormone binding globulin production => free androgens and androgen aromatization to estrone => negative feedback on FSH

### Symptoms and Presentation

- Increased androgens/testosterone: **hirsutism**, **virilism** (acne)
- Suppression of FSH: secondary amenorrhea, infertility, multiple folicular cysts on ultrasound
- Development of diabetes:

The classic presentation of a patient with polycystic ovarian syndrome is an **overweight young woman presenting with infertility, oligomenorrhea and hirsutism.** Some patients may also develop insulin resistance (seen in 50-70% of women with PCOS) leading to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus 10-15 years later.

Women with PCOS experience prolonged exposure to unopposed, increased levels of estrone (no progesterone from corpus luteum) results in an **increased risk of endometrial and breast cancer.**

### Diagnosis

Two out of three of the following criteria are required to make the diagnosis of PCOS:

- **Oligomenorrhea**
- **Hyperandrogenism**
- **Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound**
- **LH:FSH ratio > 2**

### Treatments

The treatment for polycystic ovarian syndrome includes the following:

- **Oral contraceptives (OCPs)** (primary treatment)
