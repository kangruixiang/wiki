<!-- eosinophilic pneumonia acute vs chronic sx, dx -->

This patient's presentation suggests eosinophilic pneumonia, which can be further divided into ==acute== (AEP) and ==chronic== (CEP) eosinophilic pneumonia.  ==AEP typically follows a rapid course== and is more common in ==smokers==.  CEP patients are usually ==nonsmokers==, and over 50% have a history of asthma (preceding or after symptom onset).

CEP presents with insidious onset of fever, cough, progressive dyspnea, wheezing, ==weight loss== (often marked), and ==night sweats==.  Unlike in AEP patients, hypoxemic respiratory failure is rare.  Chest radiograph shows ==bilateral peripheral or pleural-based opacities== ("photographic negative" of pulmonary edema) ==sparing the perihilar and central lung regions==, which is virtually pathognomonic for CEP.  Laboratory studies show ==peripheral eosinophilia > 6==%, elevated ==erythrocyte sedimentation rate== and ==C-reactive protein levels==, and thrombocytosis.

==Bronchoalveolar lavage== with > ==25% eosinophils== is highly suggestive of CEP.  Lung ==biopsy== usually shows interstitial and alveolar eosinophils with multinucleated giant cells and associated bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia.  AEP and CEP usually respond within 48 hours to ==glucocorticoids== (intravenous for AEP, oral for CEP) with symptom improvement, resolution of x-ray findings, and decreased eosinophilia.  Lack of improvement suggests an alternate diagnosis.  Relapses occur in up to 50% of CEP but are infrequent in AEP.  Treatment is continued for 3 months with gradual tapering over the next 3 months.
