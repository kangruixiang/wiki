Ogilvie syndrome is most common in hospitalized or **institutionalized men** age >60.  Although its etiology is unclear, it is suspected to be related to autonomic nervous system dysfunction in the setting of prior insults (eg, trauma, surgery, infection, **neurologic disorders**), particularly in combination with metabolic abnormalities (eg, **hypokalemia**, hypomagnesemia) or inciting medication (eg, **narcotics**).  Patients typically have abdominal distension, pain, nausea/vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea.  Examination commonly reveals a distended abdomen with increased tympany, mild tenderness, and active bowel sounds; peritoneal signs are suggestive of perforation.

**CT scan** is diagnostic and can differentiate Ogilvie syndrome from mechanical obstruction (presence of transition point) and toxic megacolon (thickened colonic wall with thumbprinting).  Treatment is initially supportive.  **Serial abdominal examinations** and x-rays should be performed to evaluate for perforation.  In addition, management includes ==nasogastric tube decompression==, treatment of possible underlying causes (eg, electrolyte imbalances, narcotic cessation), and early ambulation.

**Neostigmine** is indicated in patients who fail 24-48 hours of conservative therapy and in those with a cecal diameter >12 cm.  It can lead to bradycardia, bronchospasm, and hypotension and is contraindicated in those with certain cardiovascular risk factors (recent myocardial infarction, bradycardia, beta blocker therapy), active bronchospasm, or peptic ulcer disease **(Choice B)**.  Patients who fail neostigmine or have contraindications may require colonoscopic or surgical decompression, including a percutaneous tube cecostomy.
