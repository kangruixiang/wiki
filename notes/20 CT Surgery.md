# 20 CT Surgery

<!-- ignore.. -->

- path
	- hole between left and right. Noncyanotic
	- increased flow and O2 to lungs
		- increased pulmonary arterial pressures and resistance, PHTN, RVH, Eisenmenger

## ASD

- path: hole between LA and RA
- pt
	- any age. Most common after 1 yo
	- fixed split S2
- diagnosis: echo
- treatment: close hole with device

## VSD

- path: hole between V
- pt:
	- most common <1, either fixed or die
	- asx but loud murmur or no murmur but FTT and CHF
	- Down syndrome
- diagnosis: echo
- treatment
	- asx: wait up to year
	- CHF: surgical repair

## PDA

- path: aorta to PA persisting
- Symptoms
	- murmur not present on day 0
	- continous machine like murmur or continuous **multiphasic** murmur
- diagnosis: echo
- treatment:
	- closure when needed
	- Indomethacin
	- may need PGE for Transposition to keep open until surgery

# R to L

- must be catastrophic failure leads to blood not going to lungs
- Cyanotic at birth
- Die if don't fix right away

## Transposition of Great Vessels

<!-- transposition of great vessels path, pt, symptoms, treatment -->

- path
	- RA to RV to aorta to Vena Cava to RA
	- LA to LV to PA to PV to LA
	- PDA in utero allow oxygenation of systemic blood
- pt
	- moms already diabetic and not in gestation: heart devs at wk 8. Failure to twist

<!-- ignore.. -->

- path: EDC defect
	- large VSD
	- overriding aorta push aside PA

	- Deoxygenated blood to RA/RV and to both PA and aorta. Deoxygenated blood to rest of body
	- Blood to PA oxygenated and go to either PA and aorta. Result: mixed blood in both PA and Ao
- pt: Down syndrome
- symptoms
	- blue baby dies at birth
	- tet spells: blue who pinks up on squatting (more blood to RV and increased SVR)
- diagnosis

	- diagnosis: echo
- treatment: surgery

# Coarctation

- Path
	- narrowing must be descending/distal to great vessels
	- blood can't get to lower extremities
	- extra blood to top
	- collaterals develop
- pt
	- HTN in upper, hypotention in low extremities
	- warm upper, cool lower
	- Claudications: child refuse to walk and cry
- diagnosis
	- echo
	- no angiogram or xray for rib notching (no collaterals yet)
- treatment: surgery
