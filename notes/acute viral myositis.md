This patient's presentation (calf pain, abnormal gait, and elevated creatine kinase) is consistent with **viral myositis**.  Viral myositis, also known as benign acute childhood myositis, is most common in young children who are recovering from viral infections.  **Influenza** is the most commonly implicated virus.  Viral myositis presents with the acute onset of muscle pain, usually in the **calves**.  The calves are tender to palpation and in severe cases may be visibly swollen.  Affected children have **abnormal gait**, either toe-walking (as in this case) or wide-based; some children may refuse to ambulate altogether.

Laboratory testing shows **elevated creatine kinase**, but is otherwise normal.  Hematuria and renal dysfunction are absent, which differentiates viral myositis from rhabdomyolysis, a more severe muscle breakdown that causes acute kidney injury **(Choice C)**.  Viral myositis is a self-limited condition that will **resolve spontaneously**.  Influenza-associated viral myositis is not an indication for antiviral therapy if the child does not meet typical criteria for treatment (eg, hospitalization, age <2).
