# avoid fruit juice in viral gastroenteritis

<!--  viral gastroenteritis in peds management -->

- fluid rehydration
	- if PO rehydration, use hypo-osmolar solution with electrolytes and small amount of glucose
	- avoid water alone
	- avoid fruit juice until sx improves
		- Excessive consumption of juice high in fructose (eg, apple juice) or sorbitol increases osmotic load and leads to **fructose malabsorption** in the small intestine.  In addition, a mild, transient lactase deficiency with dairy intake can result from gastroenteritis due to inflammation and damage to the intestinal epithelium.

Children who can tolerate oral intake can resume a **normal**, age-appropriate **diet**.  This should consist of a balance of complex carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats.  The previously popular BRAT (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) diet is no longer recommended as it is unnecessarily low in calories and protein.  **Sugary** foods (eg, bananas, applesauce) increase the osmolarity of stool in the intestinal lumen, and excessively fatty foods increase gastric acid secretion.  Both can worsen gastroenteritis symptoms.
