Bicuspid aortic valve (AV) is one of the most common (about 1% of the population) types of congenital heart disease. It can occur sporadically or as an autosomal dominant inherited disorder with  incomplete penetrance. Patients with uncomplicated bicuspid valves  typically have an ejection murmur and a sound or click best heard at the lower left sternal border.  BAV is also a risk factor for **aortic dilation**, with a  reported prevalence of 20%â€“80%. Progressive aortic dilation can occur  in the aortic sinuses, aortic root, or ascending aorta, leading to **aortic aneurysm formation** and risk for **aortic dissection**.

Patients with BAV should have a thorough evaluation with  echocardiogram, CT, or MRI imaging to assess the aortic root and  ascending aorta for dilation. Chest x-ray is  usually unremarkable but can occasionally reveal AV calcification,  aortic enlargement (due to aneurysm), or rib notching (due to  coarctation). **Transthoracic echocardiogram** is recommended for  diagnosing bicuspid AV and for follow-up. **First-degree relatives** also  should be screened for bicuspid AV to avoid complications, ascending aorta or aortic root dilation, and dissection. Patients are at increased risk for endocarditis due to abnormal valve anatomy and function; however, routine antibiotic  prophylaxis is not recommended.
