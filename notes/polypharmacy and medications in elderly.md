Polypharmacy is common in older individuals and leads to adverse drug reactions, drug-drug interactions, prescribing cascades, and non-adherence.  Prescribing cascades occur when an adverse drug event is misinterpreted as a new medical condition and leads to further drug therapy with additional potentially adverse effects.

Drugs with anti-cholinergic side effects are among those most associated with adverse effects in the elderly.  These include memory impairment, hallucinations, confusion, blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, and urinary retention.
