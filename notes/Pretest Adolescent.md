# Pretest Adolescent

<!-- young mother pregnancy at risks for.. -->

- poor weight gain in the mother
- premature delivery
- low birth weight
- increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension
- The risk of violence is also elevated for teen mothers.

## Tanner

<!-- tanner staging male and female.. -->

Male:

- Tanner 2: sparse, thin, and **long pubic hair** with slight penile enlargement.
- Tanner 3: pubic hair becomes darker and begins to **curl**, and the penis lengthens.
- Tanner 4: it is starting to resemble adult pubic hair but without complete coverage, and the penis continues to grow.
- Tanner 5: pubic hair extends to the inner thigh and is in the typical adult configuration.

Female:

- Tanner 2: sparse pubic hair. Breasts start with buds and elevate.
- Tanner 3: larger breasts and areola without a separate areolar contour
- Tanner 4: Breasts will have **elevation of the areola**
- Tanner 5: areola is part of the general breast contour. **No secondary elevation**

## Attempt suicide

<!-- adolescent attempted suicide management.. -->

- admit for full workup even if asymptomatic

## Isotretinoin

<!-- isotretinoin se -->

- Dry skin, eyes, and mucous membranes are the most frequent complications of therapy.
- Other associated problems include musculoskeletal pain and hyperostosis, inflammatory bowel disease, pseudotumor cerebri, and corneal opacities.
- Often develop abnormal liver function tests, elevated triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and lowered levels of high-density lipoproteins.,

## Acne

<!-- food and acne.. -->

Studies have failed to demonstrate adverse effects of any particular foods on acne activity.

## Contact Sport CI

<!-- CI for sports participation. What's allowed to participate.. -->

- **Having one eye** is typically seen as a contraindication to playing contact sports like football or soccer. There are eye shields available, but in general these children are advised to avoid contact sports.
- Other reasons to recommend against contact sports participation include **hemophilia, single kidney**, and **unexplained syncope** (until evaluated).
- Stable, repaired congenital heart disease; obesity; girls with a single ovary; and controlled diabetics are routinely allowed to participate.

## Urethritis

<!-- male urethritis causes.. -->

Urethritis in an adolescent male is almost always a sexually transmitted disease (STD), either gonococcal or nongonococcal urethritis (NGU).

- Chlamydia trachomatis
- Less frequently, NGU can be caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum, Trichomonas vaginalis, and yeast. Herpes simplex can cause an NGU, but it is considerably less likely than C trachomatis.

## Testicular Torsion

<!-- testicular torsion vs epididymitis diagnosis.. -->

- Cremaster reflex absent
- Prehn sign, although not totally reliable, is elicited by gently lifting the scrotum toward the symphysis.
	- Relief of the pain points to epididymitis; it’s worsening, to torsion.
- Doppler ultrasound (or surgical consultation) is a logical first step
	- demonstrating absence of flow in torsion
	- increased flow in epididymitis.
- Alternatively, a radionuclide scan will show
	- diminished uptake in torsion
	- increased uptake in epididymitis

<!-- testicular torsion treatment.. -->

- Treatment for torsion is surgical exploration and detorsion and scrotal orchiopexy.

<!-- epididymitis causes and treatment.. -->

- path: causative organisms for epididymitis include Neisseria gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, and other bacteria. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics and rest is indicated.

## Teenager Sleep

<!-- teenager sleep pattern.. -->

Changes due to puberty cause a phase delay in the normal sleep-wake cycle, meaning teens will almost universally prefer to stay up late.

# Injuries

## Swimmers

<!-- swimmers injuries -->

shoulder injuries are the most common type of problem seen. Rotator cuff tendinitis of the biceps and/or the supraspinatus muscles presents as shoulder pain and tenderness.,

## Football

## Wrestlers

<!-- wrestling injuries -->

frequently seen in the upper extremities, especially shoulder subluxation, and in the knees, usually prepatellar bursitis from traumatic impact to the floor. Additionally, a variety of skin conditions are common, ranging from contact dermatitis and superficial fungal infections to herpes simplex (herpes gladiatorum), impetigo, and staphylococcus furunculosis or folliculitis.,

## Ski

<!-- ski injuries -->

Thumb injuries during a fall, abduction and hyperextension of the thumb, causing a sprain of the ulnar collateral ligament, remains the most common injury seen.,
