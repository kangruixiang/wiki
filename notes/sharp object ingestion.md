# sharp object ingestion

<!-- fish bone ingestion treatment, when to treat -->

The patient had an accidental ingestion of a fishbone. Depending on the severity of the obstruction, such patients can have a sudden onset of difficulty or inability to swallow oral secretions. They may also have a feeling or sensation of fullness, discomfort, or painful swallowing (odynophagia). Plain chest radiographs are useful in determining the exact location of the foreign body; however, certain objects, such as toothpicks or a fishbone, may not be easily visualized and can be missed on plain radiographs.

Most of the patients with a history of foreign body ingestion are asymptomatic and have a negative radiograph. Such patients do not need any further treatment. In all other symptomatic patients or patients with a history of sharp object ingestion (e.g., fish or chicken bone, toothpicks, needles, or pins), an urgent endoscopy should be performed to remove the foreign body and to prevent esophageal perforation.
