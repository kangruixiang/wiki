Primary **mitral valve regurgitation**  (MR) is defined as MR caused by an intrinsic defect of the mitral valve  apparatus (eg, leaflets, chordae tendineae) and is differentiated from  secondary MR, which results from other cardiac disease (eg, myocardial  ischemia, dilated cardiomyopathy). This patient's echocardiogram  reveals **severe, chronic primary MR**, which is likely due to myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve. Atrial fibrillation  (AF) due to left atrial dilation is a common complication of severe MR.

A large portion of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) flows  back into the left atrium in patients with severe MR; therefore, the  effective LVEF is much lower than estimated by echocardiogram. As a  result, in order to prevent irreversible loss of left ventricular  function, surgery is recommended for **both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients** with severe, chronic primary MR and **LVEF 30%-60%**; mitral valve repair is preferred over replacement whenever possible.  Patients with LVEF <30% likely have life-limiting, permanent systolic dysfunction, and surgery is deemed worthwhile only when there is a high likelihood of successful and durable valve repair (rather than  replacement). Preemptive surgery is indicated in asymptomatic patients  with LVEF >60% who are excellent candidates for successful and  durable valve repair.

Medical therapy is of limited utility in patients with severe primary  MR. When necessary, typical heart failure medications (eg, ACE  inhibitors, beta blockers, diuretics, aldosterone antagonists) are used, but surgery is the only proven and definitive therapy.
