- Postmenopausal women who are getting adequate calcium from dietary intake alone (approximately 1200 mg daily) do not need to take calcium supplements.
- Women with inadequate dietary intake should take supplemental elemental calcium (**generally 500 to 1000 mg/day**), in divided doses at mealtime, such that their total calcium intake (diet plus supplements) approximates 1200 mg/day.
- Women should also ingest a total of **800 international units of vitamin D daily**. Higher doses are required if they have malabsorption or rapid metabolism of vitamin D due to concomitant anticonvulsant drug therapy. Most postmenopausal women with osteoporosis require vitamin D supplementation as it is difficult to achieve goals with diet alone.
