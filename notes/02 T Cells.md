# CD8

<!-- CD8 T cell function. What cells have MHC I. What cells don't. Why is CD8 important -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/vxLr5mL.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/72xUD9F.jpg)

- antibody, APC, macrophages, CD4 are ineffective against intracellular virus
- CD8 react to MHC I and kill cell

## MHC I

<!-- MHC I structure -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/XGF4xER.jpg)

- heavy chain = alpha
