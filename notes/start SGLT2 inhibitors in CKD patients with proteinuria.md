Patients with **chronic kidney disease** (CKD) should receive treatment for the underlying cause of the renal disease, such as blood pressure medications (eg, hypertensive nephrosclerosis) and glycemic control (eg, diabetic nephropathy).  Those with **proteinuric** CKD should receive **additional medications** that have been shown to **slow progression** of renal disease **regardless of underlying cause**.

The following medications exert a renal protective effect (independent of blood pressure and glycemic control) by reducing glomerular hyperfiltration:

- ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers
- Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem)
- **Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors** (eg, dapagliflozin)

SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce glucose and sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule.  In addition to decreasing serum glucose and blood pressure, these medications **reduce glomerular hyperfiltration** by restoring tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms that are disrupted in CKD (regardless of cause).  Dapagliflozin specifically has been shown to reduce proteinuria and slow the progression of renal disease in both **diabetic and nondiabetic** patients with proteinuric CKD.
