<!-- transverse myelitis vs GBS -->

Transverse myelitis is an **inflammation of the spinal cord**. The term _myelitis_ refers to inflammation of the spinal cord; _transverse_ refers to the pattern of changes in sensation—there is often a  band-like sensation across the trunk of the body, with sensory changes below.

Causes of transverse myelitis include infections, immune system  disorders, and other disorders that may damage or destroy myelin, the  fatty white insulating substance that covers nerve cell fibers. Symptoms include pain,  sensory problems, weakness in the legs and possibly the arms, and  bladder and bowel problems. The symptoms may develop suddenly (over a  period of hours) or over days or weeks.

This patient has a rapidly developing myelopathy as  evidenced by flaccid paralysis and paresthesias, along with a clearly  demarcated sensory level at the umbilicus. Flaccid paralysis and  hyporeflexia with a history of upper respiratory infection (URI) may  also suggest Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).  However, a sensory level and bowel/bladder dysfunction after a URI make transverse myelitis (TM) more likely. Flaccid paralysis and  hyporeflexia are common in early stages of myelopathy (spinal shock).

MRI is necessary to diagnose the cause of acute myelopathy. In the absence of overt trauma or history of malignancy, compressive lesions such as  tumor, herniated intervertebral disk, and epidural abscess are less  likely but must still be ruled out. In addition, MRI will show  enhancement of the affected spinal cord regions with gadolinium in TM.  Three to five days of high-dose corticosteroids should be given once TM  is diagnosed. Empiric steroids may be given if there is high suspicion  of compressive myelopathy in the setting of malignancy.

A 26-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with a three day history of dull back pain, progressive difficulty in walking, and urinary retention. He had a mild upper respiratory infection one week ago, but he is otherwise healthy. He is not taking any  medications and denies drug abuse. His temperature is 36.7 C (98 F),  blood pressure is 120/76 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are  16/min. Neurologic examination reveals a decreased muscle strength (2/5) bilaterally in the lower extremities, hyporeactive knee and ankle reflexes, and decreased pain sensation up to the umbilical level. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?
