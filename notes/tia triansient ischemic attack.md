<!-- TIA evaluations b:888555608823-->

TIA is characterized by a temporary focal neurologic deficit with an absence of infarction on neurologic imaging. Similar to those of acute ischemic stroke, symptoms of TIA include hemiparesis, mono-ocular or visual field loss, dysarthria, aphasia, and sensory loss. The presence of ==paresthesia, isolated dizziness or vertigo, or memory loss== is more consistent with migraine or seizure. Patients with TIA are at high risk of stroke within the first 48 hours after symptom onset and should be evaluated promptly.

Several post-TIA stroke prediction scoring systems have been developed, with the most widely used being the ==ABCD2 score==, which is based on Age, Blood pressure, Clinical presentation, Duration of symptoms, and the presence of Diabetes mellitus (**[TableÂ 24](https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/nr/tables/mk18_a_nr_t24)**). TIA scoring systems, however, do not identify with sufficient sensitivity the highest-risk patients for whom treatment can ameliorate the risk of stroke.

Patients with ==high-grade extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis== who have a TIA in a downstream neurologic territory have the greatest short-term risk of stroke. This risk is highest within 2 weeks of TIA for those with greater than 70% stenosis, although 50% to 70% stenosis also carries significant associated risk. In the long term, the risk of stroke is high among patients with atrial fibrillation or other cardioembolic sources requiring anticoagulation.

## Management

The National Stroke Association recommends hospitalization for all patients with a first TIA within the last 24-48 hours and the following conditions:

- Duration of symptoms > 1 hour
- Symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis > 50%
- Multiple recurrent TIAs
- Atrial fibrillation or other known cardiac source of embolus
- Hypercoagulable state
- High risk of stroke after TIA as determined by the ABCD2 score

Preventive therapy (eg, aspirin, statin) is recommended for patients such as this with recent (< 2 weeks) TIA.

Expedited vascular imaging of the ICA and cardiac evaluation for ==atrial fibrillation== are required for all patients with TIA. The initial test of choice for evaluating ICA stenosis is ==duplex ultrasonography== because of its wide availability, low cost, and low risk; if high-grade ICA stenosis is detected and the patient is a candidate for surgery or stenting, ==confirmatory testing with CTA or MRA== is required before intervention. Cardiac evaluation should include ==electrocardiography for atrial fibrillation==, which may be followed by longer-term monitoring. ==Echocardiography== is performed if there is a clinical suspicion of a cardioembolic source or structural heart disease.
