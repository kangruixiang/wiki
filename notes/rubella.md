**Congenital rubella** syndrome (CRS) is a rare but debilitating complication of prenatal rubella infection, especially if the infection occurred during the first trimester. CRS classically presents with ocular abnormalities, sensorineural **hearing loss**, and cardiac defects. In addition to a failed hearing screen, this patient has an absent red reflex bilaterally, suggestive of **cataracts**, and a continuous cardiac murmur consistent with a **patent ductus arteriosus**, both classic findings of CRS. Low birth weight and microcephaly are also common, although brain imaging is typically normal, as in this patient. In addition, **purpuric lesions** ("blueberry muffin" rash, blue/purple nonblanching nodules) may be present in a minority of cases due to extramedullary hematopoiesis.

Prenatal screening for rubella is critical as counseling can be provided about the potential complications of prenatal infection. Administration of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine prior to conception can prevent infection, but the vaccine cannot be offered during pregnancy as it is a live-attenuated vaccine. Rubella infection in **unimmunized** adults may cause a transient maculopapular rash and joint pain that self-resolves. Acute rubella infection is treated with supportive care, including during pregnancy.

Congenital cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis can also present with hepatosplenomegaly, purpuric lesions, and sensorineural hearing loss. Imaging, however, typically reveals periventricular calcifications in congenital cytomegalovirus and intracerebral calcifications in toxoplasmosis.

Congenital herpes simplex virus (HSV) occurs after primary maternal HSV infection during pregnancy and can present with hydrops fetalis and fetal demise. Ascending HSV infection contracted during labor and delivery is characterized by vesicular lesions, meningitis, or disseminated disease. This infant has none of these features.

Although most neonates with congenital syphilis are initially asymptomatic, many develop hepatomegaly, jaundice, and rhinitis. A rash may be present but is typically maculopapular, not purpuric. Cardiac and ocular abnormalities are not seen.
