- pathogenesis: PAPS can be caused by an abnormal gait, overuse, or trauma.
- Sx: pain and tenderness at the anterior medial knee distal to the joint line, often exacerbated by pressure from the opposite knee while lying on the side.
- Dx: Examination shows a well-defined area of tenderness over the medial tibial plateau just below the joint line.  A valgus stress test does not aggravate the pain, indicating no medial collateral ligament involvement.  The diagnosis is primarily based on clinical features, although x-ray can exclude concurrent osteoarthritis of the knee.
