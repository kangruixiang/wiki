# neonatal lupus

- related: [[Pediatric]]

- path: transferred maternal IgG autoantibodies

- symptoms: Infants can have thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, rash, liver dysfunction (petechiae), and a congenital heart block.

- Most manifestations are self resolved; however, the congenital heart block is permanent and frequently requires pacing.,

**Neonatal lupus** can develop from transplacental passage of maternal **anti-SSA (Ro) and anti-SSB (La)** antibodies.  The presence of these antibodies in the mother is associated with a small (<2%) but significant risk of **congenital complete heart block**.  Hepatic, hematologic, and dermatologic complications are also possible.  Hydroxychloroquine does not have significant fetal toxicity, and discontinuation during pregnancy is associated with an increase in maternal SLE activity **(Choice B)**.  In contrast, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, leflunomide, and mycophenolate are contraindicated in pregnancy.
