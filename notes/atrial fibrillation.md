## epidemiology

- most common sustained arrhythmia
- affect more than 33 million persons worldwide
- Lifetime risk for atrial fibrillation is 25% in patients older than 40 years.
- Incidence is strongly associated with and increases with age.
- 10% of persons older than 80 years.
- fivefold increased risk for stroke
- increased risk for heart failure and dementia
- Among patients aged 55 years and older who have a cryptogenic ischemic neurologic event, such as a stroke or transient ischemic attack, occult intermittent atrial fibrillation is thought to be present in up to 25% of cases, and 30-day ambulatory ECG monitoring is indicated for detection. If 30-day ambulatory monitoring is inconclusive, implantation of a cardiac monitor (loop recorder) is reasonable to optimize detection of silent atrial fibrillation.

## risks

- DM
- obesity
- HTN
- CAD
- HF
- sleep apnea
- smoking
- alcohol consumption

## Duration

- paroxysmal: stops within 7 days
- persistent: last for 7 days or more
- long standing persistent: > 1 year

## Management

### unstable

- synchronized cardioversion: avoids R on T event and Vfib
- unknown duration or > 48 hours duration: initiate AC and continue for 4 weeks at least

### stable

- testing
	- TSH
	- sleep apnea
	- echocardiogram for valvular or structural heart disease, left atrial size

### Rate control

- goal:
	- <60
	- <110 in pts without lower EF

### Rhythm control

- pill-in-the-pocket approach: pts with infrequent afib and no structural heart disease
	- on BB/CCB
	- flecainide/propafenone: take at onset of episode
	- fleicanide: need AV nodal blockade such as BB to avoid 1:1 Vfib from Afib
	- Class 1c: need ischemic work up prior to initiate in hospital. Could also initiate then ischemic work up afterwards
	- Class 3: watch out for QTc prolongation (sotalol)

### Ablation

- for symptomatic afib despite antiarrythmic
- pulmonary vein isolation
- AV nodal ablation: afib with tachycardia despite rate/rhythm control. Needs permanent pacemaker. Also will remain in afib afterwards and still need AC]\(##)

### cardioversion

- pharm cardioversion: pt without structural heart disease
	- can use Ibutilide: monitor on tele for 6 hours or until QTc return to baseline due to small risk of torsades

## anticoagulation

### When to start

- afib duration < 48 hours or low risk for stroke/thrombus
	- preprocedural AC for men with chadsvasc more than 1 and women more than 2
- unclear duration or > 48 hours
	- AC for 3 weeks before cardioversion
	- can use TEE prior to cardioversion
- Continue at least 4 weeks following cardioversion due to increased risk for thrombus formation after sinus rhythm

### Valvular vs Nonvalvular

- non-valvular afib: base on CHA2DS2-VASc
	- men: AC if score ≥ 2
	- women: AC if score ≥ 3
	- other valves: aortic valve, MR, TR, mild mitral stenosis
	- can use non-vitamin K antagonist (NOAC)
- valvular afib: needs AC
	- mechanical prosthesis (mechanical valve replacement)
	- moderate to severe MS
	- cannot use NOAC, only warfarin
- Pt with HAS-BLED ≥ 3 needs regular evaluation

### Agents

- Warfarin
	- INR goal 2-3
- NOAC
	- kidney/liver function, reevaluate at least annually
	- dabigatran: thrombin inhibitor, Pradaxa
		- less intracranial bleed
		- higher GI bleed
		- dyspepsia
	- rivaroxaban: 10a inhibitor, Xarelto
		- noninferior to warfarin with stroke or embolism
		- less intracranial/fatal bleed
		- higher GI bleed risk
	- apixaban: 10a inhibitor, Eliquis
		- superior for stroke prevention
		- less major bleed risk
		- less intracranial bleed risk
	- edoxaban:
		- noninferior for stroke prevention
		- less major bleed
	- reversal agents
		- andexanet alfa or 4-factor PCC: for life-threatening bleed 2/2 10a inhibitors
		- Idarucizumab: for dabigatran, emergency invasive procedures or life threatening bleeds
- left atrial appendage occlusion: can consider in pt with CHADSVASC ≥ 3
	- lower risk for intracranial bleed
- for pts with afib s/p PCI and CHADSVASC ≥ 2
	- double therapy: clopidogrel/ticagrelor + AC
	- better than triple therapy to reduce risk of bleed
- for pts with afib and stable CAD
	- xarelto alone instead ASA + rivaroxaban
