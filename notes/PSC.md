<!-- PSC diagnosis -->

Most patients with PSC are fairly asymptomatic at presentation, and the disease is often detected initially by laboratory abnormalities. If symptoms do occur, fatigue and pruritus are most common. The diagnosis of PSC is usually confirmed with endoscopic cholangiography, which demonstrates multifocal areas of stricture and dilatation of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. MRCP is an alternative study with the advantage of being less invasive.

This patient's presentation is consistent with cholestasis due to **primary sclerosing cholangitis** (PSC), which is associated with underlying **inflammatory bowel disease** (IBD) (usually ulcerative colitis) in nearly 90% of patients.  PSC is a chronic progressive disorder of unknown etiology with inflammation, fibrosis, and stricturing, most commonly of medium and large biliary ducts.

Patients are usually ==asymptomatic== but can present with ==fatigue, pruritus==, and a ==cholestatic pattern of elevations== in liver function tests.  Continued bile duct destruction leads to end-stage liver disease and portal hypertension.  Ultrasound is usually nondiagnostic; a cholangiogram (either endoscopic or magnetic resonance) may show **multifocal narrowing and dilation** of both **intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts**.  Liver biopsy is helpful for disease staging and prognosis, and can reveal intrahepatic ductal obliteration with moderate lymphocytic infiltration and periductal "==onion skin" fibrosis==.

PSC patients with IBD are at significantly **increased risk** of **colorectal cancer**.  Current guidelines recommend **==colonoscopy==** with full biopsies in newly diagnosed patients with PSC regardless of the presence of other symptoms.  Patients found to have IBD require yearly follow-up with colonoscopy; those with PSC but without IBD should have colonoscopy every 5 years.  Liver transplantation is the preferred treatment for PSC as medical therapy (eg, cyclosporine) does not appear to slow progression of the disease **(Choice B)**.

Although glucocorticoids are an important treatment for IgG4-related cholangitis, they have not been shown to improve survival in PSC and can worsen bone loss.

Ursodeoxycholic acid is a mainstay of treatment for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), which can present similarly to PSC.  However, PBC usually affects women (90% of cases), and biopsy shows mononuclear cell-mediated destruction and/or periductal granulomatous inflammation of intrahepatic bile ducts.  Ursodeoxycholic acid does not have a clear role in management of PSC.
