# PSC

<!-- PSC diagnosis -->

Most patients with PSC are fairly asymptomatic at presentation, and the disease is often detected initially by laboratory abnormalities. If symptoms do occur, fatigue and pruritus are most common. The diagnosis of PSC is usually confirmed with endoscopic cholangiography, which demonstrates multifocal areas of stricture and dilatation of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. MRCP is an alternative study with the advantage of being less invasive.
