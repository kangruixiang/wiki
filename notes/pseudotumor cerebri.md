# Pseudotumor cerebri

<!-- pseudotumor cerebri pt, sx, dx, rx -->

- aka idiopathic intracranial hypertension
- pt:
	- women, childbearing age, obese
	- **Vitamin A excess** (isotretinoin for acne)
	- **Danazol** (old synthetic steroid used to suppress gonadotrophins, replaced by GnRH agonists). Glucocorticoids
	- **OCP**
	- **Tetracyclines**
- patho: not understood
- sx: headache, variable, visual disturbances, nausea. **Pulsatile tinnitus**: whooshing sounds. **No alterations in mental status**
- dx:
	- ophthalmoscopic exam for papilledema
	- imaging
	- LP: An opening pressure greater than 20-25 cmH2O can help to confirm the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri.
- Treatment options for idiopathic intracranial hypertension include:
	- **Acetazolamide**
	- **Topiramate**
	- **Weight loss**
	- **Invasive procedures** (lumbar puncture, shunt placement, optic nerve fenestration) LP relieves pressure

For patients with symptoms refractory to medical therapy or those with progressive vision loss, **surgical intervention with optic nerve sheath decompression or lumboperitoneal shunting** is recommended.  **Short-term use of corticosteroids or serial lumbar puncture (LP)** can serve as bridging therapy for patients awaiting definitive surgical treatment.  These are not recommended as primary intervention due to side effects associated with long-term corticosteroid use and the complications associated with LPs.

Untreated idiopathic intracranial hypertension can lead to **blindness.**
