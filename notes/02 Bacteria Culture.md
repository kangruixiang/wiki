- Blood: enriched (blood) and differential (blood pattern)
- Eosin methylene blue: selective (gm-) and differential (lactose fermenting)

# Special growth requirements

## Superoxide dismutase and catalase

<!-- What type of baceria use superoxide dismutase and catalase. MOA -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/uWcjyWb.jpg)

- O2 radical toxic to bacteria. Must be neutralized by aerobic organisms

## Aerobes

<!-- key aerobic bacteria -->

## Anaerobes

<!-- anaerobe bacteria location, causes disease when and where, what antibiotic doesn't work on them -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/FnwGF72.jpg)

- no O2 in abscess

<!-- why does pus have foul smell -->

- bacteroides: appendicitis

<!-- Key anaerobe infections by what bacteria and treatment -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/fN6PENR.jpg)

- Aspirate vomit
- Clindamycin for anaerobe above diaphragm (lung)
- Metronidazole for anaerobe below diaphragm
- Also can use cipro/quinolone for diverticulitis/appendicitis

## Intracellular
