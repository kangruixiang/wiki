# Genetic Syndromes

<!-- trisomy 13 aka, path, risks, symptoms -->

- aka Patau
- path:
	- In most cases all or a majority of the extra **13 chromosome** is present. Translocation can be a cause, thus imparting 10% risk of recurrence and the need for parental testing.
	- defect in the fusion of the **prechordal mesoderm**, an integral embryological structure affecting growth of the midface, eyes, and forebrain.
- Risks
	- Advanced maternal age is commonly noted
- Symptoms
	- Precordal mesoderm fusion result in catastrophic midline defects, including holoprosencephaly, microcephaly, **microphthalmia** (small eyes), **cleft lip/palate**, and **omphalocele**.  Abnormal brain development results in intellectual disability and seizures.  Additional abnormalities include **polydactyly** and **cutis aplasia** (focal skin defect of the scalp).
	- complex heart lesion including atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and dextrocardia.
	- rocker bottom feet.,

# Angelman

<!-- angelman aka, path, symptoms -->

- Aka “happy puppet syndrome”  In most case
- path: it is caused by an interstitial deletion of chromosome **15q1-q13**; the deleted material always comes from the **maternal** side (the same deleted segment from the paternal side results in Prader-Willi).
- symptoms
	- **unusual gait** and the unprovoked **outbursts of laughter**.
	- large mouth with tongue protrusion, hypopigmentation with **blond hair and pale blue eyes**.,

# Cri Du Chat

<!-- cri du chat path, symptoms -->

- path: Deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5 is the etiology.
- symptoms:
	- microcephalic, has a rounded face, hypertelorism, and epicanthal folds
	- The distinctive, catlike cry is likely caused by abnormal laryngeal development; it tends to resolve with time. Profound mental retardation, self-injury behavior, hypersensitivity to sound, and repetitive behaviors are commonly seen. About 85% of cases are paternal in origin.,

# Cornelia de Lange

<!-- cornelia de lange symptoms -->

- symptoms: Features include **bushy eyebrows**, hirsutism, limb defects, VSD, and mental retardation.,
