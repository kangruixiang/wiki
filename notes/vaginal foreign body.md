This **prepubertal girl** likely has a **vaginal foreign body**, a common cause of vaginitis in this patient population. Toilet paper is a common vaginal foreign body; other retained objects include small toys and rubber bands. When the foreign body becomes retained in the vagina, it irritates the vaginal mucosa and results in **intermittent vaginal bleeding** and a chronic, **malodorous vaginal discharge**. Patients typically have **no vulvar symptoms** (eg, pruritus, erythema, lacerations) and an otherwise normal examination.

Vaginal foreign bodies are typically **diagnosed clinically** on external pelvic examination with the patient in the knee-chest or frog-leg position. Objects that are easily visualized can be removed in the office with either warm saline irrigation or a cotton swab. For patients who cannot tolerate the procedure or in whom the foreign body cannot be easily removed, vaginoscopy under general anesthesia is performed.
