This patient has **intermittent asthma** symptoms (less than daily, no waking, normal postbronchodilator FEV1).  Guidelines recommend treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (eg, budesonide) plus formoterol as needed.  This strategy addresses **leukocyte-induced bronchoconstriction** as the central pathophysiology of asthma:

- ICSs target leukocytes and should be included at **every step** of asthma, even for patients with intermittent symptoms.

- Formoterol targets bronchoconstriction and is the preferred long-acting beta agonist (LABA) because it has **fast-onset** kinetics (<5 min) and is therefore effective for acute relief.

Short-acting beta agonists (SABAs) (eg, albuterol) are an alternative to formoterol in patients with very infrequent intermittent symptoms, but ICSs should be taken when a SABA is used.  SABA monotherapy increases the risk for future exacerbation, probably because the underlying airway inflammation is not addressed.  Frequent SABA use also down-regulates airway beta-2 receptors, which dampens bronchodilator responsiveness over time.

Long-acting antimuscarinic agents (LAMA) (eg, tiotropium) are indicated for step-up therapy in patients with uncontrolled asthma despite scheduled high-dose ICS-formoterol.  LAMA monotherapy is preferred as initial treatment for most patients with COPD; combined LAMA/LABA therapy (eg, umeclidinium-vilanterol) is used for patients who have a higher symptom score and a history of frequent exacerbations (COPD Group D).
