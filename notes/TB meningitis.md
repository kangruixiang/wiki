<!-- TB meningitis sx, dx -->

This patient likely has **tuberculous meningitis**, a highly fatal form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB).  Manifestations typically begin with 2-3 weeks of prodromal symptoms (eg, headache, low-grade fever, lassitude) followed by progressive signs of  meningeal irritation (eg, nuchal rigidity, vomiting, confusion).  Cranial nerve palsies, coma, and seizures may occur. **Choroidal tubercles** (yellow-white nodules near the optic disc) are often detected via funduscopic examination.

Suspicion for tuberculous meningitis is typically raised when brain imaging reveals **basilar meningeal enhancement** and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination shows the following:

- **Elevated protein** (>250 mg/dL, generally 100-500 mg/dL)
- **Low glucose** (<10 mg/dL)
- **Lymphocytic pleocytosis**
- Elevated adenosine deaminase

Definitive diagnosis requires serial lumbar punctures with **CSF examination for acid-fast bacilli** using smear and culture.
