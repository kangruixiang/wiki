- pseudohypoparathyroidism: abnormal sensor to PTH in kidney and bone
	- lab looks like secondary hyperparathyroidism
	- high PTH, low Ca, high phos

A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department following an episode of generalized **tonic-clonic seizure**.  Intravenous benzodiazepine was administered, terminating the patient's seizure.  He has had no trauma, fever, headache, vomiting, or cough.  For the last 2-3 months, the patient has had muscle pain and cramping that is exacerbated by exercise and relieved after a short rest.  His mother states that for the past year his school performance has been deteriorating.  Physical examination shows a sedated child who is arousable to painful stimuli.  There are no dysmorphic features.  Eye examination reveals pupils that are 3 mm in diameter and briskly reactive to light; bilateral cataracts are seen.  The heart, lungs, and abdomen are normal.  The patient moves all extremities on painful stimulation.  Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ throughout.  Serum calcium is **6 mg/dL**, serum albumin is 3.8 g/dL, serum phosphorus is 8.2 mg/dL, and **parathyroid hormone level is 150 pg/mL** (normal: 10-65).  A non-contrast CT scan of the head reveals calcification of the basal ganglia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's hypocalcemia?
