<!-- GBS respiratory management, prognosis -->

- high risk of respiratory failure: frequent measure **vital capacity** and **negative inspiratory force**
- **plasma exchange** or **IVIG** to combat antibodies against nerves
- Patients with GBS should receive plasma exchange or IVIG if:
	- **Nonambulatory**
	- **Within 4 weeks of symptom onset**
- Those who are ambulatory and recovering generally do not require treatment.
- Transverse myelitis is typically treated with high-dose glucocorticoids, not GBS

The manifestations of **Guillain-Barr√© syndrome** (GBS) tend to evolve as follows:

- 2 weeks of progressive motor weakness that can lead to paralysis
- 2-4 weeks of plateaued symptoms
- **Slow, spontaneous recovery over months**

At a year after symptom onset, 85% of patients with GBS have regained the ability to walk and nearly 60% have had full, spontaneous neurologic recovery.  Although patients with GBS typically recover without intervention, treatment with plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin **shortens the time to recovery** by approximately 50%.
