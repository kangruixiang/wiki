Classic GBS presents as a progressive, symmetric **ascending** weakness or paralysis, often a few days to a week after a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection (especially _Campylobacter jejuni_).  About one-third of patients have ==no history of antecedent illness==.  As the weakness ascends (eg, difficulty walking with 3/5 strength in the lower extremities compared with 4/5 strength in the upper extremities in this patient), **==bulbar** symptoms== (eg, ophthalmoplegia, facial diplegia, **dysarthria**, dysphasia) and ==respiratory compromise== can develop.  **==Back pain==** can be a presenting feature of GBS as the disease targets primarily the proximal nerves and nerve roots in either the cervical or lumbar spine.  Although GBS is primarily a motor polyneuropathy, patients can have ==mild sensory symptoms== such as paresthesias and sensory ataxia.  GBS patients also are at risk of developing ==dysautonomia== (eg, tachycardia, diaphoresis, **sluggish pupils**).  Examination shows **==absent reflexes==**.

**==Lumbar puncture==** is indicated in all suspected GBS patients to rule out infectious etiologies and document elevated cerebrospinal protein with a normal cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count **(albuminocytologic dissociation)**.  However, lumbar puncture may not be diagnostic in some GBS patients as it may take up to a week after symptom onset to see the abnormal findings.  Nerve conduction study and electromyography are also indicated to confirm the diagnosis and estimate prognosis.

Treatment is mainly supportive, with **plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin**.  Current evidence does **not** recommend corticosteroids as they are not beneficial.  Most patients recover within several weeks to months.

<!-- GBS respiratory management, prognosis -->

- high risk of respiratory failure: frequent measure **vital capacity** and **negative inspiratory force**
- **plasma exchange** or **IVIG** to combat antibodies against nerves
- Patients with GBS should receive plasma exchange or IVIG if:
	- **Nonambulatory**
	- **Within 4 weeks of symptom onset**
- Those who are ambulatory and recovering generally do not require treatment.
- Transverse myelitis is typically treated with high-dose glucocorticoids, not GBS

The manifestations of **Guillain-Barré syndrome** (GBS) tend to evolve as follows:

- 2 weeks of progressive motor weakness that can lead to paralysis
- 2-4 weeks of plateaued symptoms
- **Slow, spontaneous recovery over months**

At a year after symptom onset, 85% of patients with GBS have regained the ability to walk and nearly 60% have had full, spontaneous neurologic recovery.  Although patients with GBS typically recover without intervention, treatment with plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin **shortens the time to recovery** by approximately 50%.
