Most guidelines suggest a screening endoscopy in patients with frequent gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms and ≥2 risk factors for Barrett esophagus (eg, age ≥50, male sex, tobacco use).

Esophageal biopsy (4-quadrant biopsies within every 2 cm) is performed in patients with visual evidence of intestinal metaplasia on endoscopy.  Patients with intestinal metaplasia **without dysplasia** on pathologic evaluation can undergo **surveillance endoscopy in 3-5 years**.  Patients with low-grade dysplasia require surveillance endoscopy every 6-12 months or endoscopic eradication therapy (eg, ablation, mucosal resection).  High-grade dysplasia is an indication for endoscopic eradication therapy.

This patient has Barrett esophagus without dysplasia and requires surveillance endoscopy in 3-5 years.  Because there is no high-grade dysplasia, he does not need endoscopic ablative therapy or mucosal resection **(Choice A)**.  Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy can decrease the patient's symptoms, heal the esophagitis, and may slow the progression of Barrett esophagus to cancer.
