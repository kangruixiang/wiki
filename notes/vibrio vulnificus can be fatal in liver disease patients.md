This patient’s presentation is consistent with _Vibrio vulnificus_ infection, a gram-negative bacterium that causes serious wound infections and sepsis.  The organism is most virulent in patients with cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, and chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, hepatitis).  _Vibrio vulnificus_ is associated with undercooked or raw shellfish, especially raw oysters.  Since the infection can be fatal, high-risk patients should avoid eating, or even handling, raw shellfish.

Patients typically present with ==wound infections==, ==sepsis without a clearly defined infectious source==, and/or ==gastroenteritis== with characteristic ==bullous skin lesions==.  Diagnosis is confirmed with culture (wound, stool, blood), and suspected patients should receive ==immediate antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline) with close ICU monitoring==.  Patients can rapidly decompensate (within 12 hours) and develop ==bullous lesions, DIC, and even death==.
