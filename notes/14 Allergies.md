# 14 Allergies

<!-- acute allergies in peds pathology and types.. -->

- path: IgE mediated, exposure to trigger causes mast cell cross linking/degranulation. Histamine releases that mediates reaction

3 types for acute:

- anaphylaxis
- urticaria
- Angioedema

## Anaphylaxis

<!-- anaphylaxis vs urticaria vs angioedema. Symptoms, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

- symptoms: urticaria (rash) all over body + **hypotension**, wheezing, loss of airway
- diagnosis: clinical
- treatment
	- epinephrine 1:1000 IM ASAP
	- H1/H2 blockers for histamine relief
	- Steroids: lessen immune reaction

## Urticaria

- symptoms: wheal, whelt, erythema, **no hypotension**
- diagnosis: clinical
- treatment
	- usually self limiting: observe, topical antihistamines
	- rule out anaphylaxis
- Case: someone with bee sting. Treat anaphylaxis if present. Otherwise treat urticaria

## Angioedema

- symptoms: **Swelling airway** and wheezing. **No hypotension or rash**
- Always with ACE I use
- diagnosis: clinical
- treatment
	- secure airway
	- H1/H2 blockers
	- Steroids
	- rule out C1 esterase deficiencies: give FFP

# Chronic

<!-- 2 types of chronic alleriges.. -->

- allergic rhinitis
- allergic conjunctivitis

## Allergic Rhinitis

<!-- allergic rhinitis triggers, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

- Triggers: seasonal (weed, pollon) or perinneal (around all the time, smoking, dusts, pets)
- symptoms
	- allergic shiners and salute
	- pale, boggy mucosa; polyps in nose
	- cobblestoning from postnasal drip
- diagnosis
	- **clinical only**
	- RAST and skin testing only when refractory or for desensitization
- treatment
	- avoiding triggers
	- **intranasal steroids**
	- H2 > H1

<!-- pale, boggy mucosa, polyps, cobblestoning are. Happens when.. -->

<!-- allergic shiner and salutes are. Happens when.. -->

- Allergic rhinitis

**Allergic shiners** are dark circles under the eyes caused by congestion of the nose and sinuses. They're usually described as dark, shadowy pigments that resemble bruises:

The **allergic salute** is the characteristic and sometimes habitual gesture of wiping and/or rubbing the nose in an upwards

<!-- allergic conjunctivitis symptoms.. -->

# Food allergies

<!-- food allergies types, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

- Usually outgrow: wheat, soy, milk, eggs
- May carry throughout life and cause anaphylaxis: shellfish, nuts
- symptoms: NVD, look for other allergy signs (asthma, atopic dermatitis). Can cause **anaphylaxis**
- diagnosis: food trial: withdraw all agents, introduce one at a time
- treatment: avoid triggers, epi

# Milk Protein Allergy

<!-- milk protein allergies path, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

- path allergy to soy
- symptoms: NVD, bloody bowel movement. Failure to thrive despite feeding adequate amounts
- diagnosis: clinical
- treatment: change formula to cow's milk, breastfeed, hydrolyzed formula
