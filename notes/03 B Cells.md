# 03 B Cells

<!-- B cell function, histology -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/A2zyFOR.jpg)

# BCR

<!-- BCR components -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/1fwbEZG.jpg)

- FAB: fragment antigen binding
- FC: constant
- Made of monomer IgM antibody

![](https://i.imgur.com/dyO6NT8.jpg)

- purple: variable regions. Vary from 1 B cell to another
- light chain: 1 constant region; heavy chain 3 constant regions
- variable regions end in nitrogen groups; constant end in carboxyl group
- Connected by disulfide bridges
- macrophage Fc/protein A binds CH2-CH3 region

## Heavy chain

<!-- BCR made how -->

# Activation

<!-- 2 ways of B cell activation -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/oxVfk7C.jpg)

<!-- T Dependent B activation process -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/4cfprgr.jpg)

1. B cell crosslinked by antigen
2. Second signal required in addition to crosslinking
3. MHC 2 binds TCR and CD4
4. CD40 binds CD40L: class switching
5. B7 binds CD28: T cytokine secretion

<!-- T dependent B activation via macrophage process -->

- macrophage antigen presenting instead

## T Independent

<!-- T independent B activation process. Why is this process important. Comparison with T dependent -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/3akFi8f.jpg)

- so many antigen on surface, B cell activated without T

<!-- T dependent vs independent B activation -->

## Conjugated Vaccine

<!-- Conjugated vaccine why, examples -->

# Surface Proteins

<!-- B surface proteins, functions -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/lujcvb1.jpg)

- CD21 receptor for complement, receptor for EBV

# Antibody

<!-- 3 different shapes of antibodies -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/RxxJjBn.jpg)

<!-- Antibody 3 functions -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/gCTQ0p5.jpg)

## Protein A

<!-- Protein A bacteria, function -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/lRLA8sB.jpg)

- prevents opsonization:

## Class Switching

<!-- B class switch process, triggers -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/KtWItuK.jpg)

- only change Fc portion, not FAB portion

![](https://i.imgur.com/XAy53KN.jpg)

- Cm and Cd closes
- Cm and Cd spliced out; B starts to make Cy (IgG), Ca, Ce

## IgM

<!-- IgM functions, good for, bad for, complement? Cross placenta? -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/pBviPSN.jpg)

- Classical pathway: 2 C1 molecules bind together to Fc of IgM; easy to bind because so many IgM Fc together
- Prevents attachment: very large and clumps on to pathogens
- Weak opsonin: too big; macrophages can't get to Fc

## IgG

<!-- IgG function, good for, placenta? -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/bXte5WE.jpg)

- macrophages bind to Fc very easily

## IgA

<!-- IgA function, monomer vs dimer when, complement? Why are they good for mucosal infections? -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/NhdPoTh.jpg)

- secretory component in middle of 2 IgA
- linked by secretory: can't complement

## IgA Protease

<!-- IgA protease bacteria -->

## IgE

<!-- IgE binds, complement? pathogenesis for allergy -->

# Somatic Hypermutation

<!-- somatic hypermutation is, process, when does it happen -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/11Zxg0l.jpg)

- Happens during proliferation after activation
- Stronger binding will proliferate the most

# Development Timeline

# Vaccines

<!-- 2 types of vaccines -->

- active
- passive

## Active

<!-- Active vaccines function, types -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/o1HPdOJ.jpg)

<!-- live attenuated vs killed -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/qFfnmuH.jpg)

- Live attenuated: T cell mediated response
- Killed: antibodies against HA antigens of virus
- Inactivated viral vaccines do not infect host cells and therefore do not enter the MHC class I antigen-processing pathway, which is normally required for the generation of a significant CD8+ cell-mediated immune response.  In contrast, live-attenuated viral vaccines strongly stimulate the MHC class I antigen-processing pathway and can generate cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes that kill infected cells.

<!-- oral vs IM vaccines -->

## Passive

<!-- passive vaccines are, time, memory, examples -->

![](https://i.imgur.com/ozbdHnz.jpg)

- give if suspicion for rabies, tetanus: neutralize before infection happens
