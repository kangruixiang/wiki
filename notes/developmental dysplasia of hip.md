# developmental dysplasia of hip

- related: [[Pediatric]]

DDH:

- pt: female, breech position, family hx
- cause: abnormal dev, femoral head displaced, excessively tight swaddling
- sx:
	- asymmetrical inguinal folds. Fold extend beyond anal aperture
	- leg length discrepancy on **Galeazzi test**
- dx:
	- barlow, ortolani maneuvers
	- US < 4 months
	- Xray > 4 months
- rx:
	- when diagnosed within first 6 months of life, treat with Pavlik harness for 3 months, but needs monitor with surgery
	- referral to surgery after diagnosis
- prognosis:
	- Most infants who are treated early have **no long-term sequelae**.  However, residual dysplasia can still occur, so patients require close follow-up until skeletal maturity is reached.  Residual dysplasia potentially warrants surgery and can lead to **osteoarthritis**, but this risk is low for infants treated for DDH in infancy
