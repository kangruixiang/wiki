This patient has **cervical insufficiency**, a structural weakness of the cervix that predisposes to **painless** (ie, no uterine contractions) **cervical dilation** and second-trimester pregnancy loss. However, such patients can present with **pelvic pressure** when the gestation distends the vagina, with an increase in **vaginal discharge** due to loss of the mucus plug, or with **light vaginal bleeding** (eg, bloody show). Bulging or prolapsing amniotic membranes can also be present.

The diagnosis of cervical insufficiency can be based retrospectively on >2 prior painless spontaneous second-trimester losses. It can also be based on presentation of painless advanced cervical dilation at <24 weeks gestation in the current pregnancy. Risk factors include collagen abnormalities (eg, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), uterine anomalies (eg, septate or bicornuate uterus), obstetric trauma, and surgical trauma (eg, cold knife cone).

Cerclage placement, a procedure during which a suture is placed to reinforce the cervix, has been generally shown to prevent second-trimester loss and preterm delivery in patients with cervical insufficiency. In patients with a history-based diagnosis, a prophylactic **cerclage** is placed at 12-14 weeks gestation. In patients with second-trimester, painless cervical dilation in the current pregnancy, cerclage placement is typically performed at diagnosis.

**Prolapsing amniotic membranes**, as seen in this patient, are a predictor for imminent (ie, within the next several days) delivery and indicate a **poor prognosis**. Prolapse of the membranes into the vagina causes prolonged exposure to vaginal flora and a high risk for intra-amniotic infection (chorioamnionitis), preterm membrane rupture, abruptio placentae, previable or preterm delivery, and maternal mortality. Prolapsed membranes are a **relative contraindication** to cerclage placement due to a high risk for iatrogenic membrane rupture. Therefore, even with cerclage placement, the prognosis for this pregnancy is poor, and the most likely outcome is a previable or preterm delivery
