<!-- MEN 2 MTC management -->

**Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2)** is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline mutations involving the _RET_ proto-oncogene located on chromosome 10. MEN 2 can be divided into 3  classifications: MEN 2A, MEN 2B, and familial medullary thyroid cancer  (FMTC). **MEN 2A** predisposes to **medullary thyroid cancer (MTC)**, **pheochromocytoma (PCC)**, and **hyperparathyroidism** (due to parathyroid hyperplasia or multiple adenomas). **MEN 2B** is not accompanied by hyperparathyroidism but may be associated with  marfanoid habitus, mucosal neuromas, and skeletal deformations (eg,  kyphoscoliosis, lordosis). FMTC is a subset of MEN 2A associated with  MTC only, without PCC or parathyroid disease.

All patients with MTC require serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic  antigen, neck ultrasound (evaluation for regional metastases), genetic  testing for germline _RET_ mutations, and evaluation for  coexisting tumors (hyperparathyroidism, PCCs). PCC is present in  approximately 40% of patients with MEN 2, and undiagnosed PCC can cause  life-threatening **hemodynamic complications** during and after thyroid surgery. **Plasma-free metanephrines** are usually elevated in PCC and confirmed with 24-hour urinary  fractionated metanephrines, catecholamines, and abdominal imaging. Once PCC has been ruled out, patients with nonmetastatic MTC may proceed to  thyroidectomy for definitive management.

Anticancer drugs and external beam radiation do not play a role in  initial management of MTC. Radiotherapy is usually reserved for  postsurgery patients with extrathyroidal disease or extensive nodal  metastases not amenable to surgical resection. Chemotherapy is  considered for patients with progressively metastatic MTC not responsive to surgery or radiotherapy.

Radioactive iodine is preferentially taken up by thyroid tissue and is  often used following surgery for patients with differentiated thyroid  cancer (papillary or follicular) who are at risk for recurrence.  Radioactive iodine is not effective for MTC as these cells do not take  up iodine.
