# diabetes insipidus

- related: [[Endocrine]]

Diagnosis

- If urine output < 300cc/hr x3 hours, then get DI labs
- one dose dex won't interfere cortisol level
- random cortisol: 3-18 normal range
- use prednisone for secondary DI as no aldosterone needed. Does not need hydrocortisone

## Causes

In addition to increasing the prednisone, the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) analogue desmopressin acetate is the most appropriate treatment. This patient most likely has central nervous system sarcoidosis and central diabetes insipidus (DI). ==Nearly half of hypothalamic-pituitary sarcoidosis cases occur in the course of previously treated sarcoidosis==. Central DI results from inadequate release of ADH from the posterior pituitary gland. In the presence of ADH, aquaporin water channels are inserted in the collecting tubules and allow water to be reabsorbed. In the absence of ADH, excessive water is excreted by the kidneys. Frank hypernatremia is unusual because patients develop extreme thirst and polydipsia, and with free access to water, can maintain serum sodium in the high normal range. When patients do not drink enough to replace the water lost in the urine, due to poor or absent thirst drive or lack of free access to water, they develop hypernatremia. DI is diagnosed with simultaneous laboratory evidence of inability to concentrate urine (urine osmolality <300 mOsm/kg H2O) in the face of elevated serum sodium and osmolality. If necessary, a water deprivation test can confirm the diagnosis. A response to exogenous ADH would support a diagnosis of central DI, whereas a lack of response is seen in nephrogenic DI.
