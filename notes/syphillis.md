## Syphillis

<!-- congenital syphilis sx -->

_Treponema pallidum_ crosses the placenta; a **syphilis infection during pregnancy** can result in **vertical transmission**, leading to **adverse fetal outcomes** including fetal growth restriction, intrauterine fetal demise, and congenital syphilis (eg, hepatomegaly, jaundice, rash, skeletal abnormalities).

<!-- syphillis testing -->

The diagnosis of primary syphilis can be made on the basis of dark-field examination of material from a suspect lesion. Serologic test results may be negative in early primary infection.

Diagnosis of secondary and tertiary syphilis relies on serologic testing. Many laboratories use the “reverse” serologic testing strategy, starting with an automated enzyme immunoassay followed by a nonspecific test (rapid plasma reagin or Venereal Disease Research Lab test). Patients with a positive enzyme immunoassay result but negative rapid plasma reagin or Venereal Disease Research Lab test result should have a second specific treponemal antibody test to confirm the result. Those with a confirmed positive result and no history of syphilis treatment should be offered treatment for syphilis of unknown duration.

This woman's serologic results are consistent with successfully treated syphilis, and no additional testing or treatment is indicated. Many laboratories use a “reverse” screening strategy, whereby a treponemal test, such as an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), is performed first and, if positive, is followed by a nontreponemal test (rapid plasma regain \[RPR] or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory \[VDRL] test). If the EIA is positive and the RPR or VDRL is negative, the positive result should be confirmed by a second treponemal test (such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody test performed in this patient). A positive EIA (confirmed by a second test) with a negative RPR is the expected serologic result in a patient who has been treated for syphilis. The treponemal test (EIA) remains positive indefinitely, but the nontreponemal test (RPR or VDRL) should remain negative.

If the nontreponemal test became positive again, it would indicate a new infection, and treatment, based on disease stage, would be indicated. If this patient had reported no history of treatment for syphilis, she should be treated for syphilis of unknown duration, which consists of 3 weekly doses of intramuscular benzathine penicillin. Single-dose benzathine penicillin is indicated for the treatment of primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis.

Because the positive EIA result was already confirmed by a second treponemal test, the fluorescent treponemal antibody, additional testing with another treponemal test, such as the _Treponema pallidum_ particle agglutination assay, is not necessary.
