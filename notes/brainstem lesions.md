# brainstem lesions

<!-- wallenberg syndrome symptoms -->

Careful assessment of a patient's signs and symptoms can help localize lesions  within the central nervous system. Lesions of the thalamus or cortex  are associated with sensory loss in the **contralateral**  face and body. Cortical lesions are also associated with specific  findings such as aphasia, neglect, or agraphesthesia. In contrast,  brainstem lesions typically involve the cranial nerves and impair  sensory perception over the **ipsilateral** face and **contralateral** body.

This patient's presentation suggests right-sided **lateral medullary infarction** (Wallenberg syndrome) most likely due to an occluded intracranial vertebral artery.  Vestibulocerebellar findings are the most debilitating; patients may  report difficulty feeding themselves and often overshoot targets due to **ipsilateral** limb ataxia. Sensory findings include loss of pain and temperature in the **ipsilateral** face and **contralateral** trunk/limbs. Patients typically have sparing of voluntary motor  function in the face and body. Diagnosis is made via magnetic resonance imaging; acute treatment usually involves intravenous thrombolytics  (eg, tissue plasminogen activator).

## Gertsmann syndrome

<!-- parietal lobe dominant vs nondominant lesion sx -->

Damage to the dominant parietal lobe, especially the inferior parietal lobe, presents as **Gerstmann syndrome**.  The patients have difficulty in performing simple arithmetic tasks  (acalculia), inability to name individual fingers (finger agnosia),  impaired writing (agraphia) and right/left confusion (difficulty in  identifying or distinguishing the right or left side of the body).

Almost 90% of right-handed patients and 60% of left-handed patients have a left hemispheric dominance for speech and language functions. The  patient in the above scenario appears to be suffering from **construction apraxia.**  This is seen with the involvement of parietal lobes, and is much more  pronounced with lesions of the right parietal hemisphere **(nondominant parietal lobe)**.  Patients have marked difficulty in copying simple line drawings. They  may also experience difficulty in wearing clothes, and appear to  struggle while attempting to get into a coat or pants. This is known as **dressing apraxia**, which is seen with bilateral or  right-sided (nondominant) parietal lobe lesions. Confusion is also seen in patients with lesions of the nondominant parietal lobe.

## Temporal lobe

<!-- temporal lobe lesion sx -->

Lesions of the nondominant temporal lobe can cause  visual disorders (homonymous upper quadrantanopia) and impaired  perception of complex sounds (auditory agnosia).

Dominant temporal lobe lesions, in addition to having homonymous upper  quadrantanopia, almost always involve the language functions, and  lead to aphasia. Wernicke's aphasia is usually seen in patients with  dominant temporal lobe lesions. It is characterized by the impairment  in comprehension of spoken or written language. Patients have  difficulty in expressing their thoughts in a meaningful manner. Apraxia is not seen in temporal lobe lesions.
