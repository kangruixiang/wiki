## PV Curve

<!-- PV Curve what happens overview -->

## Isovolumetric contraction

<!-- Isovolumetric contraction, PV curve where -->

Point 3 to 5

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/MNF879l.jpg)

.At point 3, the cycle is at end diastole with the mitral valve closed; LV has been filled by the EDV.  The ventricles begin contraction when the mitral valve closes and before the aortic valve opens (point 5), the period of highest O2 consumption

## Systolic ejection

<!-- Systolic ejection, PV curve where -->

Point 5 to 7.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/MNF879l.jpg)

.At point 5, pressure in ventricle rises high enough to push open aortic valve and the total stroke volume is ejected into the aorta. The ventricle volume decreases, but the ventricular pressure continues to increase until near the very end of this phase. At point 7 , the pressure drop causes the aortic valve to close. The width of the pressure-volume loop is measured graphically to represent the stroke volume. The volume remaining in the LV at point 7 is end systolic volume.

## Isovolumetric Relaxation

<!-- Isovolumetric relaxation, PV curve where -->

Point 7 to 1.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/MNF879l.jpg)

.After point 7, the ventricle begins to relax. Since all the valves are closed again, the ventricular volume is constant (isovolumetric) in this phase

## Ventricular Filling

<!-- Ventricular filling, PV curve where -->

Point 1 to 3.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/MNF879l.jpg)

.At point 1, the mitral valve opens and the filling of the ventricles begins. Initially, a rapid filling period begins which is followed by a reduced filling

## Valves

<!-- Valves on PV Curve<br ><img src='d839YQG.jpg' alt='_' / -->

- 3: mitral valve closes
- 5: aortic valve opens
- 7: aortic valve closes
- 1: mitral valve opens

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SEKMuIB.jpg)

## Preload Increases

<!-- PV curve, Increased preload result in EDV, SV, EF -->

Leads to an increase in ventricular end-diastolic volume and results from increased venous return. This, in turn, results in an increase in stroke volume and ejection fraction based on the Frank-Starling relationship. Since increased preload causes increased stroke volume, this results in an increased width of the pressure-volume loop..

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/n8TOh78.jpg)

## Preload Decreases

<!-- PV curve. Decreased preload result in EDV, SV, EF -->

Decreased width..

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/6hYiboo.jpg)

## Afterload Increases

<!-- PV curve. Increased afterload result -->

- Requires the ventricle to pump against a higher pressure = higher pressure overall
- At end of systole, same pressure leaves more volume in the ventricles = increased ESV = decreasing stroke volume..

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/v1xXDqf.jpg)

## Contractility Increases

<!-- PV curve. Increased contractility result -->

The ventricle is able to develop greater tension than usual during systole, causing an increase in stroke volume..

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/Vcg0cmM.jpg)

## Decreased Contractility

<!-- PV curve. Decreased contractility results -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/opa37ie.jpg)..

## Compliance Changes

<!-- PV curve. Decreased compliance result -->

Stiffer ventricle: higher pressure at lower volume. This results in a decrease in end-systolic volume..

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/9bWLIpT.jpg)

| When Value High | SV   | EDV  | ESV  |
| --------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Preload         | up   | up   | same |
| Compliance      | up   | up   | same |
| Contractility   | up   | same | down |
| Afterload       | down | same | up   |

# Jugular Venous Tracing

<!-- What is jugular venous pressure measuring -->

Measures pressure in the:

- Jugular vein
- Right atrium, left atrium
- Pulmonary vein..

<!-- What are a, c, x, v, y waves -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/XENYzFI.jpg)

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/i2qmZpt.jpg)

- c: tricuspid valve/mitral valve close. S1 sound
- v: atrium relax, blood to RV..

## A Wave

<!-- A wave is -->

Increase in right atrial pressure during **atrial contraction** (i.e atrial systole).

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/XENYzFI.jpg)

**a** wave = **A**trial contraction

## Absent a wave

<!-- Absent A wave caused by -->

Characteristic of **atrial fibrillation** due to a lack of coordinated atrial contraction.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/GGL2kBg.jpg)

## Large/giant a wave

<!-- Large, giant a wave caused by -->

Indicate the right atrium is contracting against **increased resistance to right ventricular filling**. May be seen with:

- **Tricuspid stenosis**
- Right ventricular hypertrophy
- Pulmonic stenosis
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Right atrial myxoma
- RHF.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/zDL2yHC.jpg)

## Cannon a wave

<!-- Cannon a waves is and caused by -->

Are caused by the right atrium contracting against **a closed tricuspid** valve, which most commonly occurs during **junctional arrhythmias**

- Vent Tach
- 3rd degree (complete) heart block
- PAC/PVC.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/2VCBH3p.jpg)

## V wave

<!-- v wave caused by -->

Increase in right atrial pressure during late ventricular systole due to **right atrial filling against a closed tricuspid valve**. Usually corresponds with (or occurs just after) the T wave on EKG.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/XENYzFI.jpg)

**v** wave = **V**enous filling

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SMSYBOK.jpg)

## Large, giant V wave

<!-- Large, giant, V wave aka -->

aka CV fusion.

<!-- Large, giant, v wave caused by -->

Can occur due to **tricuspid or mitral regurgitation**.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SecxIsQ.jpg)

## C wave

<!-- c wave caused by -->

Increase in right atrial pressure during right ventricular isovolumic systole (contraction); **due to bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium**.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/XENYzFI.jpg)

**c** wave = tri**C**uspid valve

## X Descent

<!-- The x descent caused by -->

Is the decrease in jugular venous pressure due to movement of blood from the venous system to the right atrium. It is caused by **atrial relaxation and the downward displacement of the closed tricuspid valve during right ventricular systole**.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/XENYzFI.jpg)

**X** descent = atrial rela**X**ation

## Absent x descent

<!-- Absent x descent caused by -->

Occurs in **tricuspid regurgitation**. Backflow of blood into the right atrium during systole prevents relaxation of right atrial pressure. (may see a positive wave).

## Prominent x descent

<!-- Rapid, prominent, x descent caused by -->

Occurs in:

- Constrictive pericarditis (also has a prominent “y” descent)
- Cardiac tamponade (absent “y” descent).

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/Sr24DG3.jpg)

Prominent x descent due to high JVP

## Y Descent

<!-- y descent caused by -->

Decrease in right atrial pressure following the peak of the “v” wave; due to tricuspid valve opening and right atrium emptYing.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/XENYzFI.jpg)

## Absent y

<!-- Absent y descent caused by -->

Cardiac tamponade (The right atrium is unable to relax following the "v" wave due to the presence of fluid around the heart).

In cardiac tamponade, right ventricular filling is impaired throughout diastole, and therefore the y-descent (which represents the fall in right atrial pressure immediately after tricuspid valve opening as blood rushes into the right ventricle) is blunted (less steeply downsloping).

In Tamponade, active pressure is being exerted on the heart throughout the cardiac cycle. The pericardial pressure exceeds the diastolic pressure, leading to decreased filling pressure gradient. This results in a blunted or absent Y descent.

## Slow y

<!-- Slow y descent caused by -->

Tricuspid stenosis is a common cause on JVP.

## Rapid y

<!-- Rapid, prominent, y descent caused by -->

Occurs in:

- Constrictive pericarditis
- Severe right heart failure
- Tricuspid regurgitation (The large CV wave sets the stage for a large “y” descent.).

In pericardial constriction, the earliest phase of diastolic right ventricular filling is not impaired and the y-descent is not blunted -- in fact, because it is descending from a higher-than-normal right atrial pressure, the y-descent may be accentuated, commonly called a "rapid y-descent".

In Constrictive Pericarditis, the pericardium is rigid and can't move inwards or outwards properly. During the cardiac cycle, the ventricle is constricted after its systole but pericardium has not moved with it. Therefore there is lots of room in between and there is minimal pressure at the start of diastole. This leads to rapid ventricular filling as no resistance is offered to the expanding ventricle. This results in a prominent Y descent.

## Tricuspid valve opens

<!-- In JVP tracing, when does tricuspid valve open? -->

From v wave to c wave.

## Tricuspid valve closes

<!-- In JVP tracing, when does tricuspid valve close -->

From c to v wave.

Happens during S1

# Cardiac Cycle

<!-- The cardiac cycle is -->

The process of cardiac filling and ejection, and is often visualized with electrocardiography or jugular venous pressure readings..

<!-- Cardiac cycle overview. What happens -->

Cardiac cycle overview process:

1. Atrium contract, pump blood into ventricle
2. Mitral valve and tricuspid closes
3. Isovolumetric ventricular contraction
4. Aortic and pulmonic valve opens
5. Blood flows from ventricle to aorta and pulmonary artery
6. Aortic valve closes
7. isovolumetric relaxation
8. Mitral valve opens, back to #1..

## Atrial Systole

<!-- Atrial systole is, JVP -->

The activation of the atria, pumping atrial blood into the ventricles. Also known as **atrial kick**. Happens **before mitral valve closes**..

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SMSYBOK.jpg)

JVP shows a wave:

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/XENYzFI.jpg)

## S1

<!-- S1 happens when, JVP, EKG, PV curve -->

The **sound of the atrioventricular (tricuspid and mitral) valves closing**; it occurs at the **beginning of isovolumetric ventricular contraction and beginning of QRS**.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SMSYBOK.jpg)

EKG: S1 is QRS

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/JUEvoQJ.jpg)

JVP shows c wave. **c** wave = tri**C**uspid valve closing and bulging into RA

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/hKeHzrL.jpg)

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/W7DXrXv.jpg)

## Isovolumetric Ventricular Contraction

<!-- Isovolumetric ventricular contraction happens when, JVP, PV curve -->

The ventricles contract **after mitral valve closes** and **before the aortic and pulmonic valves open**.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SMSYBOK.jpg)

JVP: c wave from tri**C**uspid valve bulging into RA

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/hKeHzrL.jpg)

PV curve goes from 3 to 5

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SEKMuIB.jpg)

<!-- Highest O2 consumption in cardiac cycle -->

Isovolumetric contraction..

## Rapid Ventricular Ejection

<!-- Rapid ventricular ejection is, JVP, PV curve -->

The period of ventricular contraction **after the aortic and pulmonic valves have opened** (pushed open by pressure) and **before middle point of ejection cycle**, when the ventricles are ejecting blood into the pulmonic and systemic circulations.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SMSYBOK.jpg)

## Reduced Ventricular Ejection

Follows rapid ventricular ejection and results from decreased ventricular volume. This follows the length-tension relationship described by the Frank-Starling equation, where contraction strength is directly related to the load; therefore, a decreased volume would translate into a decreased load, which means less contraction strength and reduced ventricular ejection.

- **X** descent = atrial rela**X**ation
- **V** wave = **V**enous filling

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/XENYzFI.jpg)

PV curve goes from 5 to 7

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SEKMuIB.jpg)

## S2

<!-- S2 happens when, JVP, PV curve -->

Is the **sound of the aortic and pulmonic valves closing**.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SMSYBOK.jpg)

**V** wave = **V**enous filling

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/XENYzFI.jpg)

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/W7DXrXv.jpg)

<!-- S2 splitting is -->

Normally, the aortic valve closes before the pulmonic valve. "Splitting” of the second heart sound can occur during **inspiration** when negative intrathoracic pressure increases venous return, ultimately **delaying closure of the pulmonic valve**..

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/JUEvoQJ.jpg)

## Isovolumetric Ventricular Relaxation

<!-- Isovolumetric ventricular relaxation is, JVP, PV curve -->

The period **between the aortic valve closing and the mitral valve opening**.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SMSYBOK.jpg)

**V** wave = **V**enous filling. Right after T wave on EKG

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/XENYzFI.jpg)

PV curve goes from 7 to 1

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SEKMuIB.jpg)

## Dicrotic Wave

<!-- Dicrotic wave or notch is -->

The trough is where the aortic valve closed, and the following **"bump" in pressure results from aortic pressure recoil against a closed aortic valve**..

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/fiTf9I1.jpg)

## Rapid Ventricular Filling

<!-- Rapid ventricular filling is, JVP, PV curve -->

Happens when the atrial pressure becomes slightly greater than the ventricular pressure. It starts **when the mitral and tricuspid valves open**.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SMSYBOK.jpg)

**y** = atrium empt**Y**ing

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/XENYzFI.jpg)

PV curve goes from 1 to 3

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SEKMuIB.jpg)

## S3

<!-- S3 happens when -->

Results from **blood sloshing against the ventricular walls** during the middle third of diastole.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/SMSYBOK.jpg)

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/M2S0fYB.jpg)

<!-- S3 physiologic causes and demographics -->

Physiologic S3, aka suckers:

- Demographics: **young patients <30, pregnant women**
- **Vigorous LV relaxation** lowers pressure rapidly, resulting in rapid LV filling
- Normal LA pressure..

<!-- Pathologic S3 causes -->

Pathologic S3, aka pushers:

- **High LA pressure**, leading to rapid early filling of LV
- Usually association with high LVEDP (dilated ventricle)..

<!-- S3 sounds louder when and why -->

Louder when patient **lies on left side and with exhalation** due to **heart closer to chest wall**.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/HfcEdLc.jpg)

<!-- S3 sounds like -->

Sounds like **Ken-tu-cky**.

## S4

<!-- S4 happens when -->

Is a low frequency diastolic sound that occurs during the late diastolic filling phase (the atrial kick). It results from an **atrial kick filling a ventricle with decreased compliance, often seen in left ventricular hypertrophy**. (Blood hitting stiff wall).

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/M2S0fYB.jpg)

<!-- S4 Cause -->

Usually caused by **stiff left ventricle** from:

- Long standing HTN
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Diastolic HF.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/ak8fiCI.jpg)

<!-- S4 cannot occur in what pathological heart state -->

Cannot occur in **Afib** because there is **no atrial kick**.

<!-- S4 physiologic demographics -->

It is sometimes heard in the **elderly** due to a stiff ventricle.

<!-- S4 sounds like -->

Sounds like **Ten-nes-see**.
