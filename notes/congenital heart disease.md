This neonate with mild cyanosis at birth followed by rapid clinical deterioration on day of life 1 most likely has **hypoplastic left heart syndrome** (HLHS). Patients with HLHS, a **ductal-dependent** congenital heart defect, have an underdeveloped left ventricle and  aorta as well as an atretic mitral and/or aortic valve. The right  ventricle is therefore responsible for supplying both pulmonary and  systemic blood flow.

For the right side of the  heart to adequately oxygenate and perfuse the body, oxygenated blood  must be delivered to the right atrium (via an atrial septal defect or  patent foramen ovale) and blood must flow from the pulmonary artery to  the aorta via a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The mixing of  oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the right atrium accounts for mild **cyanosis** immediately after birth. As pulmonary vascular resistance physiologically decreases and the PDA closes around **day of life 1**, neonates with HLHS rapidly develop severe cyanosis, **respiratory distress**, and cardiogenic **shock** due to inadequate systemic perfusion. Often, no murmur is audible, but a single S2 may indicate an absent aortic valve or developing pulmonary hypertension.

Immediate administration of **prostaglandin E1** in patients with suspected HLHS is required to maintain the **patency** of the **ductus arteriosus** and, in turn, systemic perfusion.

Tetralogy of Fallot and truncus arteriosus are cyanotic heart defects, but they are not ductal-dependent.  Tetralogy of Fallot may present with "tet" spells, which are episodes of severe cyanosis due to right ventricular outflow obstruction. Truncus  arteriosus typically presents in the neonatal period with signs of heart failure (eg, respiratory distress, poor feeding) due to excessive  pulmonary blood flow. With these lesions, a systolic ejection murmur is typically heard.

A 1-day-old boy is in the newborn nursery for routine care. He was born to a  35-year-old mother at 38 weeks gestation via normal spontaneous vaginal  delivery. There were no known complications with the pregnancy or  delivery. The patient has breastfed several times and has voided and  had a bowel movement. At 24 hours of life, standard pulse oximetry  screening shows oxygen saturation of 89% in the right upper extremity and 88% in the left lower extremity. Physical examination reveals a slightly  dusky-appearing infant who is crying and moving all extremities  equally. Auscultation reveals a regular rate and rhythm with no  murmurs. Over the next few hours, the patient develops increasing respiratory distress and hypotension. Repeat pulse oximetry demonstrates oxygen saturations <80% in all extremities. Blood pressure in all extremities is symmetric but low. The extremities are cold with diminished peripheral pulses. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
