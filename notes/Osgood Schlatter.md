<!-- osgood schlatter pt, pathogenesis, sx, dx, rx -->

- patient: adolescent male athletes. Early adolescence (typically ages 13-14 for affected males, and ages 10-11 for affected females)
- pathogenesis:  This condition is caused by chronic/repetitive strain at the insertion of the patellar tendon on the tibial tubercle and is seen in pre-adolescent and adolescent patients undergoing rapid growth spurts. 
- Sx: **worsened by sports** that involve repetitive running, jumping, or kneeling, and it **improves with rest**.  Approximately one fourth of affected individuals have bilateral disease. 
- Dx: On physical examination, there is edema and **tenderness over the tibial tubercle**.  **A firm mass** can sometimes be felt due to heterotopic bone formation.  Pain can be reproduced by **extending the knee against resistance**. 
	- Radiographic findings are nonspecific and include anterior soft tissue swelling, **lifting of tubercle** from the shaft, and irregularity or fragmentation of the tubercle. 
- Treatment consists of activity restriction, stretching exercises, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications.

Like [[patellofemoral pain]] syndrome, Osgood-Schlatter disease can cause anterior knee pain that is worse with squatting; however, it would not be seen in adult patients.
