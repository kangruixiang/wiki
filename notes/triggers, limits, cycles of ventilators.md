- trigger: what initiates each breath
	- assisted breaths are triggered by patient
	- controlled breaths are triggered by machine
- limits: the target for each breath. Could either be pressure or flow (volume)
	- flow targeting: ventilator adjusts pressure to maintain flow
	- pressure targeting: ventilator adjusts flow to maintain inspiratory pressure
- cycle: what ends each breath. Either time or reduction in inspiratory flow
