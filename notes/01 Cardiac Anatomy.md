## Fibrous Pericardium  

<!-- Fibrous pericardium is and function -->

**Strong external layer that limits the expansion of the pericardial cavity**; it is continuous with the adventitia that surrounds the great vessels entering and exiting the heart.

<!-- Fibrous pericardium anchored via -->

Fused to the diaphragm on its inferior surface and is **anchored to the sternum by connective tissue called the sternopericardial ligaments**.

## Serous Pericardium

<!-- Serous pericardium layers -->

Composed of parietal and visceral layers:

- **Parietal layer**: The parietal layer forms the inner layer of the fibrous pericardium and is the most external layer of the serous pericardum; it is fused to the fibrous pericardium, which is external to the parietal layer.
- **Visceral layer (epicardium)**: The visceral layer covers the external surface of the heart itself and is the innermost layer of the pericardium deep to the parietal layer and fibrous pericardium.

# Internal Anatomy

<!-- Cardiac myocytes have what type of junction -->

**Cardiac Myocytes** form the myocardium on a microscopic level. They are precisely coordinated by **gap junctions within intercalated discs** that allow rapid spread of electrical signals between cells.

## SA Node

<!-- SA Node is and location -->

The pacemaker of the heart. Exhibits automaticity by spontaneously generating action potentials.
Located at the **junction of the superior vena cava** and the **right atrium.** Initiates the electrical impulses to stimulate contraction.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/7avV4Iv.jpg)

## AV node

<!-- AV Node location and function -->

Located between the atria and ventricles and conducts the signal from the sinoatrial node to the rest of the heart. It **slows down conduction** between the atrium and the ventricles, allowing time for the ventricles to fill with blood before contraction.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/7avV4Iv.jpg)

## Bundle of His

<!-- Bundle of His is, function, and clinical result -->

Bundle of specialized cardiomyocytes (bigger cells with fewer contractile elements → less electrical resistance) that propagate signals from the AV node down into the ventricles.
Clinical Correlate: Defects in the His-Purkinje system are responsible for **second degree heart block: Mobitz type 2.**

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/7avV4Iv.jpg)

## Left and Right Bundle Branches

<!-- Left and right bundle branches are, function, and clinical correlation -->

Branches of the bundle of His that conduct to the left and right ventricles via Purkinje fibers.
Clinical Correlate: These can become blocked in heart failure → left or right bundle branch block.

## Purkinje fibers

<!-- Purkinje fibers location, function -->

Located along the edges of each ventricle, conduct the signal from the bundle of His and bundle branches to ventricular cardiomyocytes.

# Right Atrium

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/DII11VM.jpg)

## Chordae Tendinae

<!-- Chordae tendinae are and function -->

Fibrous cords that attach the papillary muscles to the valve cusps; the tension created by contracting papillary muscles and taut chordae tendinae **prevent the cusps of the AV valve from prolapsing into the atrium** as the ventricle contracts and the pressure on the valve increases.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/DII11VM.jpg)

# Left Atrium

<!-- Left atrium location and why it's important -->

There are two main coronary arteries, the **left coronary artery (LCA) and right coronary artery (RCA)**.

## LCA

<!-- LCA originates and becomes -->

Originates from the left aortic sinus and bifurcates into:

- **LAD (left anterior descending) artery**, which gives off superficial (diagonal) and multiple deep (septal perforator) branches. anterior LV
- **LCX (left circumflex) artery** .

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/QNXy66S.jpg)

<!-- LCA and RCA both supplied by -->

Supplied by the ascending aorta.

## LCX

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/QNXy66S.jpg)

<!-- Left Circumflex Branch, LCX, supplies -->

Supplies:

- Posterolateral wall of left ventricle
- Anterolateral papillary muscle along with LAD.

## LAD

<!-- Left anterior descending artery aka -->

Aka **anterior interventricular artery**.

<!-- LAD location -->

Passes within the anterior interventricular sulcus toward the apex.

<!-- Left anterior descending branch, LAD, supplies -->

Supplies:

- Anterior wall of left ventricle
- Anterior 2/3 of the interventricular septum, or superior septum
- Anterolateral papillary muscle along with LCX.

<!-- Mitral valve anterolateral vs posteromedial papillary muscle supplies -->

Since the **anterolateral papillary muscle** is supplied by both the LAD and LCX, it is relatively resistant to infarction. In contrast, the **posteromedial papillary muscle** is more susceptible to ischemic injury since it is supplied by a single arterial branch: the PDA depending on dominance of the heart.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/4638SWB.jpg)

## RCA

Originates from **right aortic sinus** and upplies:

- Right atrium and ventricle (inferior walls) via right marginal artery
- Left ventricle (diaphragmatic surface) via right marginal artery
- Posterior 1/3 of the interventricular septum or the inferior septum via PDA
- Right posteromedial papillary muscle via PDA
- AV node (**in right-dominant individuals**) via AV nodal artery from PDA
- SA node via SA nodal artery.

<!-- RCA location -->

The RCA travels in the coronary sulcus between RA and RV and passes around right border of heart between the posterior and diaphragmatic surfaces.

<!-- RCA branches -->

Gives rise to the 4 branches below:

- Right marginal branch
- SA nodal artery
- PDA that also gives rises to AV nodal artery.

## PDA

<!-- Posterior descending artery aka -->

Aka **posterior interventricular artery (PIV)**.

<!-- Posterior descending/interventricular artery, PDA, supplies -->

Supplies:

- **Posterior 1/3 of interventricular septum** or inferior septum
- **Posterior walls of ventricles**
- **Posteromedial papillary muscle**.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/ofZgpX4.jpg)

<!-- What determinates dominance of the heart -->

The artery that supplies the PDA is the structure that determines **coronary dominance**:

- **Right dominant** — PDA is supplied by the RCA (85% of population)
- **Left dominant** — PDA is supplied by the LCX (8% of population)
- **Co-dominant** — PDA is supplied by both the RCA and LCX (7% of population).
