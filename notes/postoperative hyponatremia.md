This patient, who is experiencing nausea, headaches, and drowsiness following lithotripsy, has acute symptomatic hyponatremia, likely related to her recent surgery.Â  **==Postoperative hyponatremia==** can develop within hours of surgery due to ==release of vasopressin== related to surgical stress, the use of nonelectrolyte solutions (eg, glycine, sorbitol) for irrigation, or the infusion of hypotonic solutions during surgery.
