# Preeclampsia

<!-- Normal blood pressure ranges -->

Normal BP:

- Systolic: 100 - 139
- Diastolic: 60 - 89..

<!-- Biggest risk/complication with HTN -->

**Hemorrhagic stroke** is the biggest concern/risk with hypertension..

<!-- Chronic HTN is different from Gestational HTN by -->

Chronic Hypertension: HTN (BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg)..

- Before pregnancy
- Before the 20th week of gestation
- Persists after postpartum period (>12 weeks post-delivery)

# Hypertensive urgency and emergency

<!-- Difference in blood pressure and treatment of hypertensive urgency and emergency -->

- Urgency: 220/110; HTN meds and send home
- Emergency: 220/110 and **end organ damage**; ER admission

<!-- Is preeclampsia hypertensive urgency or emergency? -->

Preeclampsia is a hypertensive emergency because of proteinuria, kidney damage..

# Gestational Hyptertension

<!-- Gestational Hypertension is, diagnosis criteria -->

Pregnancy-induced hypertension that:

- Commonly presents **after 20 weeks gestation**, and can also be seen up to 6 weeks postpartum.
- No **pre-existing hypertension**
- No **proteinuria or end-organ damage**.
  Note: the abrupt onset of hypertension _before_ 20 weeks suggests molar pregnancy.. 

<!-- Difference between gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia -->

| Gestational Hypertension | BP > 220/110                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Preeclampsia             | Gestational HTN + proteinuria |
| Eclampsia                | Preeclampsia + seizure        |

# Preeclampsia

## FLT

<!-- FLTs are -->

VEGF receptor in placenta. They become sFLT in soluble form

<!-- Preeclampsia pathogenesis -->

Genetic predisposes FLT to become sFLT that float around in blood stream and absorb available VEGF. This leads to loss of VEGF action that are needed to transform cytotrophoblast to endothelial cell and remodelling of spiral arteries necessary for placental growth.

This leads to toxin secretion that leads to:

- **endothelial leakage resulting in proteinuria and ischemia**
- **increased vasoconstrictors and decreased vasodilators resulting in vasospasm and hypertension**
- **placental ischemia resulting in coagulation abnormalities**

<!-- Preeclampsia symptoms -->

The clinical presentation includes the following: 

- **Blurred vision**
- **Abdominal pain**
- **Edema of the face and extremities**
- **Altered mentation**
- **Hyperreflexia**.

<!-- Preeclampsia risks -->

There is an increased incidence in patients with:

- **Preexisting diabetes mellitus**
- **Hypertension**
- **Chronic renal disease**
- **Autoimmune disorders** (lupus)
- **First pregnancy**
- **less than 20 or greater than 35 age**.

## Preeclampsia Treatment

<!-- Treatment for chronic HTN in pregnancy -->

For chronic, oral therapy of HTN in pregnancy, the recommended drugs are:

- α-Methyldopa
- Labetalol
- Nifedipine..

## α-Methyldopa

<!-- α-Methyldopa MOA -->

Acts on α2 (Gi) autoreceptors to inhibit NE release. Has a long history of safety for the mother and the fetus.

## Labetalol

<!-- Labetalol MOA -->

α1-blocker in VSMC, causing vasodilation. Different racemic components also act as a non-selective ß-partial agonist with some ß-blocking activity as well.

## Nifedipine

<!-- Nifedipine MOA -->

L-type calcium channel blocker of the vascular type.

<!-- Rx of preeclampsia -->

- Stabilize the Mother with anti-HTN medications (labetalol, hydralazine, nifedipine)
- Prevent seizure with MgSO4
- Deliver the placenta.

Although methyldopa is available as a parenteral preparation, acute and accurate control of blood pressure is better with labetalol or hydralazine. However, if nothing else is at hand, it can be used. Drug choice depends on availability and experience with a particular drug by the physician.

<!-- Why do you not use benzodiazepines and phenobarbitals for eclampsia? -->

Seizure in eclampsia is self limiting. It will go away in 3-5 minutes. You don't need to treat that; only need to prevent it from happening with MgSO4..

<!-- How do you measure effectiveness of preeclampsia treatment -->

Use **urine output as indicator for effectiveness** of treatment..

## Hydralazine

<!-- Hydralazine MOA -->

Works via smooth muscle cell vasodilation:

- Blocks IP3, Ca release
- Releases NO via cGMP.

## MgSO4

<!-- MgSO4 MOA -->

Antagonizes the activity of calcium. Prevents origination of seizures by reducing activity of iGlut (glutamatergic, NMDA, calcium ionotropic neurotransmission). Mg also reduces vasospasm and reverses oliguria and edema by antagonizing calcium (takes up to 2 days). However, its effect on blood pressure levels is slow via volume reduction and relief of vasospasm. That is why you need the anti-HTN drugs to quickly reduce threat of stroke from high BP.

<!-- MgSO4 SE and treatment -->

Overdose of Mg **reduces excitability of CNS**, resulting in loss of patellar reflex, respiratory and cardiac arrest. First symptom is **decreased capillary reflex**.  In overdose,MgSO4 may produce nephrotoxicity of its own because of its renal clearance. In overdose, treat with **calcium gluconate** IV injection. Do not use antiepileptic medications for seizure control. MgSO4 is sufficient for seizure control and prophylaxis..

## Less than 28 weeks

<!-- Eclampsia before 28 week gestation. Action? -->

No fetal viability

- Stabilize mother and give dexamethasone to delay pregnancy
- If mother cannot be stabilized, deliver baby.

## 28 to 34 weeks

<!-- Eclampsia between 28 and 34 weeks. Action? -->

- If life of mother is threatened, deliver the baby.
- Try to maintain pregnancy to at least 34 weeks, when dexamethasone is no longer needed

## 37 to 41 weeks

<!-- 37 and 41 weeks pregnant is -->

Official full term baby.

## More than 41 weeks

<!-- When is pregnancy post term? Action? -->

Post term at 41 weeks. Induce labor via:

- Oxytocin drip: uterine contraction
- Dinoprostone: PGE2, cervical dilation

# HELLP Syndrome

<!-- HELLP Syndrome stands for -->

Stands for Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets..

<!-- HELLP is, symptoms, treatment -->

A very serious complication of pregnancy-induced hypertension. It usually only occurs with severe preeclampsia. Can lead to hepatic subcapsular hematomas, which can rupture and result in severe hypotension. 

- Laboratory findings show **thrombocytopenia and hyperuricemia**
- Peripheral blood smear shows **schistocytes**
- Treatment: **immediate delivery**

## Pathogenesis

<!-- HELLP pathogenesis -->

Platelet thrombosis in liver shears RBC, leading to hemolysis and low platelet counts. Resulting liver infarct from low O2 leads to increased liver enzymes.
