# breast abscess in feeding

<!-- breast abscess in feeding management -->

- first use **US** for diagnosis
- Once diagnosed, use **fine needle aspiration** to remove abscess
- **Incision with drainage** is the preferred treatment for most skin abscesses.  However, this treatment for a breast abscess has increased risk of complications (eg, milk fistulas), slower recovery time, and a less desirable cosmetic outcome.  Therefore, incision and drainage are reserved for abscesses that do not improve with antibiotics and fine-needle aspiration.
