## Joint aspiration

<!-- joint aspiratio leukocyte count -->

Joint aspiration findings can help narrow the differential diagnosis of  joint pain. A synovial fluid leukocyte count of less than 2,000  cells/mL is seen in patients with noninflammatory conditions such as  osteoarthritis. Leukocyte counts between 2,000 and 75,000 cells/mL are  seen in inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and  gout. Counts above 100,000 cells/mL suggest infectious arthritis.
