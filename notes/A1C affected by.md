**Hemoglobin A1c** (HbA1c) is a widely used laboratory assay for **glycated hemoglobin** and is reported as a percentage of glycated hemoglobin in the sample.  The rate of glycation is proportional to the ambient glucose concentration.  Because hemoglobin levels are usually stable, HbA1c can be used as a marker for **glycemic control** in patients with diabetes mellitus and reflects mean plasma glucose over 8-12 weeks.

However, HbA1c is vulnerable to changes in hemoglobin production and survival.  Patients with conditions that cause reduced red blood cell survival (eg, ==hemolytic anemia==) have a greater proportion of new red blood cells (ie, with nonglycated hemoglobin) and therefore a ==misleadingly low HbA1c==.  Conversely, those with **reduced blood red cell production** (eg, due to **iron deficiency**, as in this patient) have a lower proportion of new red cells and a **misleadingly high HbA1c**.

- increased destruction: low A1C because newer RBC with less glycated Hgb
- reduced production: higher A1C because of less new cells

In such cases, the underlying hematologic condition should be corrected and the HbA1c rechecked.  Alternately, serum **fructosamine**, which measures glycation of serum proteins, can be ordered; this test estimates glycemic control over 2-3 weeks.
