The eye is frequently affected, and patients often have fever, decreased visual acuity, and eye pain. Funduscopic examination typically reveals focal, glistening, white, **mound-like** lesions on the retina that may extend into the vitreous, with resultant **vitreous haze**.

_Candida_ endophthalmitis is a  vision-threatening infection and must be treated aggressively. Those  who have endophthalmitis due to hematologic seeding (as in this case)  typically develop chorioretinitis, which can then spread into the  vitreous or aqueous.

Patients with vitreous involvement usually require **systemic antifungals** such as **amphotericin B**, intravitreal antifungal injection, and **vitrectomy** (to reduce fungal microabscesses that may be recalcitrant to therapy).  Treatment with systemic antifungals for 4-6 weeks is required.
