<!--  left axial myxoma complications -->

Atrial myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumors, with the majority occurring in the left atrium.  The tumors are typically pedunculated with a stalk coming from the atrial septum, and can be extremely friable, sometimes leading to the release of **tumor emboli** into the systemic circulation.  Some large tumors can present with signs and symptoms of mitral valve obstruction (causing a diastolic murmur and "tumor plop"), rapidly worsening heart failure, and new-onset atrial fibrillation.  The diagnosis is confirmed by echocardiography (transesophageal preferred over transthoracic), and prompt surgical excision is typically indicated.

This patient has acute-onset pain, diminished pulses, and paleness and coolness of the left foot, which are consistent with **acute arterial occlusion**.  Acute arterial occlusion can occur due to an **embolus** from a proximal source, acute thrombosis of an atherosclerotic plaque, or direct trauma to the involved artery.  The sudden onset of symptoms in this young, previously asymptomatic patient is most consistent with an embolus.  Most emboli originate from a cardiac source, and may occur due to atrial fibrillation, severe ventricular dysfunction, endocarditis, valvular disease, atrial myxoma, or a prosthetic valve.  This patient has a regular heart rhythm with an **apical diastolic murmur**, making **left atrial myxoma** the most likely cause of the embolus.
