## Anterior pituitary

<!-- How does anterior pituitary communicate with hypothalamus? -->

The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland communicates with the hypothalamus by the _hypothalamic–hypophysial portal system:_

1. The hypothalamus is supplied by blood coming from the **superior hypophyseal artery.**
2. Hypothalamic hormones enter the **capillary plexus** near the median eminence, and travel via **long portal veins** to the anterior pituitary.
3. In the anterior pituitary, hormones exit a **secondary capillary plexus** to stimulate or inhibit hormone release from their specific endocrine target cells.
4. Endocrine cells respond by increasing or decreasing their output of tropic hormones into systemic circulation.

There are 6 major hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary (mnemonic: **FLAT P**i**G**):

- **F**ollicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
- **L**uteinizing hormone (LH)
- **A**drenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
- **T**hyroid stimulating hormone (TSH; thyrotropin)
- **P**rolactin
- **G**rowth hormone (GH)

<!-- Hypothalamus secretes these hormones -->

<!-- FSH/LH function -->

LH/FSH functions:

|            | LH                                       | FSH                                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Male**   | **Leydig cell:**                         | **Sertoli Cell:**                   |
|            | testosterone synthesis                   | sperm maturation                    |
| **Female** | **Theca Cell:**                          | **Granulosa Cell:**                 |
|            | testosterone synthesis, ovulation, corpus luteum formation | follicle growth, estrogen secretion |

### TSH

<!-- Thyrotropin releasing hormone, TRH, function. How does it affect dopamine -->

Stimulates the secretion of TSH and prolactin. Prolactin is under tonal dopamine inhibition, and **excess TRH levels suppress dopamine**. Thus, prolactin levels will increase as dopamine decreases.

<!-- TSH is secreted by and function -->

Secreted by thyrotrophs of the anterior pituitary and stimulates **thyroid hormone synthesis** and **release**.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/dt3I1Bs.jpg)

### Prolactin

<!-- Dopamine, also known as prolactin release-inhibiting hormone, function -->

Dopamine inhibits the release of **prolactin**.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/pQOk9fT.jpg)

### GH

<!-- Growth hormone secreted by and function -->

Secreted by somatotropes of the anterior pituitary and is counter-regulatory to insulin. It stimulates **linear height growth** via **insulin-like growth factor** (IGF-1), which is released by the liver in response to stimulation by GH.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/dt3I1Bs.jpg)

<!-- GH secretion increased by and how -->

Growth hormone-releasing hormone (**GHRH**, somatocrinin) stimulates the secretion in **pulsatile fashion**.

Also increased by

- **Exercise**
- **Sleep** (very high just after onset of sleep)
- **Starvation (hypoglycemia)**

<!-- GH decreased by -->

Is decreased by:

- Glucose
- Somatostatin (released in response to IGF-1; GH)
- IGF-1 (direct and indirect).

#### IGF-1

<!-- IGF-1 aka -->

aka **Somatomedin**.

<!-- IGF-1 secreted where -->

Many growth hormone receptors are found in the **liver**, and they secrete IGF-1, which mediates many of GH effects. IGF-1 is also produced in **peripheral tissues** and mediates its effect in paracrine fashion...

<!-- IGF effects -->

Has following effects:

- Stimulates chondrocytes, increase **linear growth**
- Stimulates muscles, **increase lean muscle mass**
- Stimulates organs, **increase organ size**

<!-- IGF-1 lab important because -->

IGF-1 is measured in serum as **indicator of GH function**, as GH is difficult to measure with its pulsatile fashion...

#### GH Effects

<!-- GH effects -->

Has following effects:

- Increased insulin resistance and blood sugar
- Increased lipolysis by activating hormone sensitive lipase
- Increased IGF-1 that results in bone, muscle, and organ growths.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/BCB3uKd.jpg)

<!-- GH blood glucose effects -->

GH **decreases blood glucose intake in to cells** and will cause anti-insulin effects:

- increased blood sugar (diabetogenic)
- increased insulin resistance in peripheral tissues
- hyperinsulinemia.

#### GH Deficiency

<!-- GH deficiency cause -->

Most common caues is pituitary tumor from masses or as result of surgery/radiation...

<!-- GH deficiency symptoms -->

Symptoms are different for children and adults:

- Children: failure to grow
- Adults: increased fat, low lean body mass, low energy..

<!-- GH deficiency treatment -->

Treatment is synthetic growth hormone and IGF-1 level monitoring..

### HCG

<!-- HCG and TSH, LH, FSH similarities -->

TSH, LH, FSH and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) share a common α-subunit, while the **β-subunit of these hormones determines hormone specificity**.

## Basophils and Acidophils

<!-- Acidophils and basophils of anterior pituitary -->

Cells of the anterior pituitary are categorized into two groups, basophils and acidophils, based on whether they stain readily with acidic or basic dyes.  To remember which type of hormone-secreting cells fall into which category, use the mnemonics “**GPA**” and “**B FLAT**”:

- “**GPA**”: **G**rowth hormone and **P**rolactin are secreted by **A**cidophils
- “**B FLAT**”: **B**asophils secrete **F**ollicle stimulating hormone, **L**utenizing hormone, **A**drenocorticotropic hormone, and **T**hyroid stimulating hormone...

## Feedback

<!-- Feedback in hypothalamus -->

Anterior pituitary hormones enter the systemic circulation and exert their effects at target glands. Eventually, the target gland response is limited by its hormonal product exerting **negative feedback inhibition** at the level of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus.

## Intermediary Pituitary

### MSH

<!-- MSH aka -->

aka melanotropin.

<!-- MSH secreted by and function -->

MSH, or melanotropin, stimulates melanin synthesis and is secreted from the **intermediate lobe** of the pituitary

<!-- MSH and Cushing's disease -->

MSH and ACTH both are derived from **pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)**. In Cushing's disease, the ACTH adenoma produces both excess ACTH and MSH, causing the characteristic darkened skin.

### Melanocyte inhibing factor

<!-- Melanocyte inhibiting factor function -->

**Inhibits the release of MSH**.

## Posterior Pituitary

<!-- How does posterior pituitary communicate with hypothalamus? -->

In contrast, the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland contains the axons of neurons whose cell bodies are located in hypothalamic nuclei. 

1. Hormones are synthesized in the hypothalamus, packaged in secretory granules and transported down the nerve axons for secretion.  
2. Upon stimulation of the hypothalamic cell bodies, hormone-containing granules are released by exocytosis into peripheral circulation, via the **capillary plexus of the inferior hypophyseal artery.**

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/87SYYdG.jpg)

<!-- Posterior pituitary 2 nuclei and their products -->

- Paraventricular nuclei: Oxytocin
- Supraoptic nuclei: ADH aka vasopressin or AVP

<!-- Posterior pituitary secretes, how -->

**Vasopressin** and **oxytocin** are two hormones that are secreted from the posterior pituitary.  Note that vasopressin is also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP).

The hypothalamus directly synthesizes hormones, which are complexed with neurophysins and shipped into the posterior pituitary for storage and secretion. The hypothalamic-pituitary hormones that utilize this _non-capillary_ secretion mechanism include **arginine vasopressin** (aka antidiuretic hormone) and **oxytocin**.

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/3GC5ofS.jpg)

### ADH

<!-- ADH is, made in -->

A nonapeptide that is synthesized predominately in the **supraoptic nucleus** of the hypothalamus, and secreted from the **posterior pituitary** upon stimulation of these cell bodies. .

<!-- ADH and Oxytocin transported how and carrier protein -->

Travels down the nerve axon in neurosecretory granules to be stored in the nerve terminals, lying in the posterior pituitary gland. **Neurophysins** are the carrier proteins which make this transport possible.

<!-- ADH's 2 main effects -->

Vasopressin has an **antidiuretic effect** (reabsorbs water) and is also a moderate **vasoconstrictor**. ..

<!-- ADH secretion stimulus -->

The primary stimulus for antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion is an **increase in serum osmolarity**.  A loss of intracellular water from hypothalamic osmoreceptor neurons bathed by hyperosmolar blood will stimulate ADH release.  Other factors that increase ADH secretion include:

- **Pain/stress**
- **Hypoglycemia**
- **Nausea**
- **Volume contraction**
- **Nicotine and opiates**
- **Angiotensin II**..

<!-- ADH secretion inhibitor -->

The primary inhibitor of ADH secretion is a **decrease in serum osmolarity**.  Other factors that decrease ADH secretion include:

- **Alpha-agonists**
- **Ethanol**
- **Atrial natriuretic peptide**
- **Cold**..

<!-- ADH function -->

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) has two primary functions:

- **Regulate serum osmolarity**
- **Maintain (increase) blood pressure**..

<!-- ADH V2 MOA -->

ADH increases water reabsorption by binding to V2 receptors on the capillary (basal) side of principal cells in the renal collecting duct:  

- ADH binding **activates adenylyl cyclase**, which increases cAMP and **activates protein kinase A.**
- Activated **protein kinase A phosphorylates aquaporin-2-containing vesicles**, stimulating their transport and fusion with the luminal plasma membrane
- The insertion of more aquaporin channels allows water to move rapidly from the tubular lumen into the collecting duct cell, reclaiming more water.
- The result is an increase in blood volume and a decrease in plasma osmolarity.  

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/3m7jI9Q.jpg)..

<!-- ADH V1 MOA -->

Vasopressin also causes vasoconstriction of arterioles through binding to **V1 receptors**, stimulating a IP3/Ca2+-mediated response.  This vasoconstriction leads to a _direct increase in arterial pressure._

Note: this function can be remembered by the latter half of the hormones name -pressin _(remember, a pressor is any agent that increases blood pressure by stimulating constriction of blood vessels_)...

\[_]\(ADH effect on urea)Antidiuretic hormone also **increases the permeability of the inner medullary collecting duct to urea**.  This increases the osmotic gradient created by the countercurrent multiplier, facilitating the production of concentrated urine (i.e. increasing urine osmolarity)..
