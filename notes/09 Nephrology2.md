# CKD

Chronic kidney disease is defined as either **decreased kidney function** (**GFR <60 mL/min**) or **kidney damage** (**urinary albumin excretion of ≥30 mg/day**) for **≥3 months**, regardless of the etiology.

The most common causes of chronic kidney disease are:

- **Type II DM** (most common)
- **Hypertension**
- **Chronic glomerulonephritis**

Stage I CKD refers to a **GFR ≥ 90 mL/min.**
There is normal kidney function but urine, structural or genetic findings suggest kidney disease.

Stage II CKD refers to a **GFR 60-89 mL/min.**
Mildly reduced kidney function.

Stage III CKD refers to a **GFR of 30-59 mL/min.**
Moderately reduced kidney function.

Stage IV CKD refers to a **GFR of 15-29 mL/min.**
Severely reduced kidney function.

Stage V CKD is **GFR < 15 mL/min.** Uremic symptoms can be present at this stage.
Very severe, or end-stage kidney failure.

There are many manifestations of chronic kidney disease. They include:

- **Altered mental status**
- **Hypertension**
- **Nausea** & **vomiting**
- **GI bleeding**
- **Peripheral neuropathy**

Lab values indicative of chronic kidney disease include:

- **Elevated BUN** & **Cr**
- **Increased K+** & **phosphate**
- \*\*Decreased Na+ \*\* & **Ca2+**
- **Normochromic**, **normocytic anemia**
- Metabolic acidosis

Small kidneys on ultrasonography suggest **advanced stage chronic kidney disease** (CKD) that is **unlikely to recover**.

_Note that the presence of normal-sized kidneys on ultrasonography does not rule out CKD._

Retention of sodium and water contributes to **hypertension** and accelerated **atherosclerosis**, **peripheral edema**, and **congestive heart failure**.

Advanced CKD can be associated with an anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

- There is **decreased excretion of hydrogen ions** (H+) in the form of ammonium, which maintains the metabolic acidosis.
- **Decreased renal excretion of organic anions** such as sulfate, phosphate, urate and hippurate increase the anion gap and also maintain the metabolic acidosis (i.e. sulfur in the form of sulfuric acid, phosphorus as phosphoric acid and so forth).

The cause of anemia in CKD can be multifactorial. The leading cause of anemia in CKD is **decreased erythropoietin production** which causes a normochromic, normocytic anemia. There are other contributing factors to anemia in CKD such as:

- Anemia due to inflammation
- Blood loss due to increased bleeding
- Marrow fibrosis due to renal osteodystrophy

Renal osteodystrophy is a complex interplay between calcium, phosphorous, parathyroid hormone, and Vitamin D. There are several contributing factors to the characteristic bone changes in CKD.

- Hyperphosphatemia can stimulate PTH secretion from the parathyroid gland.
- Decreased production of 1-α-hydroxylase also contributes to increased PTH secretion (ie secondary hyperparathyroidism).
- Hypocalcemia is due to decreased absorption from the GI tract. Calcium can also precipitate with phosphorous out into tissues (metastatic calcification).
- Osteitis fibrosa cystica (AKA “brown tumors”) is the most common type of renal osteodystrophy caused by a high rate of bone turnover. The intact PTH levels are often very elevated.

There are several mechanisms of hyperkalemia in kidney disease.

- Advanced kidney disease: inability of kidneys to excrete a potassium load. Decreased renal excretion of K leads to hyperkalemia.
- Medications such as ACE inhibitors, Digoxin and NSAIDs can worsen kidney function and be a cause of hyperkalemia in someone with CKD.
- Hyperkalemia can also be aggravated by insulin deficiency (recall that insulin causes the trans-cellular shift of K → into cells).

The increased bleeding risk in advanced CKD is due to **uremia-induced platelet dysfunction.**

The risk of infection is increased in advanced CKD due to **uremia induced-neutrophil dysfunction**.

## Treatment

**Reducing proteinuria** in Stage I CKD is vital.

- ACE Inhibitors and/or Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can reduce proteinuria and preserve kidney function
- For diabetes, obtain albumin/creatinine ratios on annual basis. Tight glucose control can prevent worsening of kidney disease and proteinuria
- If edema is present, the use of a loop diuretic may be added

**Erythropoietin stimulating agents** (ESA) are used in the treatment of anemia of chronic disease in patients with CKD.

Since iron deficiency is common in patients with CKD, **iron status** should be evaluated prior to initiating treatment with an ESA (e.g. erythropoietin). Patients with inadequate iron levels should be given supplemental iron.

Failure to correct iron deficiency prior to starting an ESA (e.g. erythropoietin) can result in a **microcytic**, **hypochromic anemia**.

Adverse effects associated with recombinant EPO include:

- **Hypertension** (most common)
- Headache
- Flu-like syndrome
- Red cell aplasia (rare, due to anti-EPO antibodies)

Dietary modifications in the treatment of chronic kidney disease include:

- **Low phosphorous diet** and the use of phosphorous binders are used for hyperphosphatemia
- Secondary hyperparathyroidism is treated by lowering phosphorous levels and normalizing calcium levels. The use of **vitamin D analogs** (a synthetic 1-alpha hydroxylase) can also be used to lower PTH levels
- Hyperkalemia is treated with a **low potassium diet**. The use of sodium bicarbonate and diuretics as needed. If hyperkalemia is refractory, dialysis may be needed.
- **Protein restriction** is utilized in advanced CKD to preserve kidney function and prevent overworking of the kidney

**Sodium bicarbonate** can be used to treat metabolic acidosis. Treating acidosis in CKD can prevent progression of CKD.

**Loop diuretics** can be used for volume management in CKD.

Absolute indications for emergent dialysis can be remembered with the mnemonic **AEIOU**:

- **A**cidosis
- **E**lectrolyte abnormalities
- **I**ngestion of toxins
- **O**verload of fluid
- **U**remia

# Diuretics

There are several classes of diuretic medication including:

- **Thiazide diuretics**
- **Loop diuretics**
- **Potassium-sparing diuretics**
- **Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors**
- **Mannitol**

## Thiazide

Thiazide diuretics (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone) **inhibit the NaCl co-transporter in the distal convoluted tubule**.

First drug of choice in most **newly-diagnosed essential hypertension**; also useful in patients with edema, congestive heart failure, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and osteoporosis.

Thiazide toxicities include:

Decreased serum levels of:

- **K+ (hypokalemia) – check potassium levels regularly**
- **Na+ (hyponatremia)**
- **H+ (metabolic alkalosis)**

Increased serum levels of (mnemonic ‘GLUC’):

- **Glucose (hyperglycemia)**
- **Lipids (hyperlipidemia)**
- **Uric acid (hyperuricemia)**
- \*\*Calcium (hypercalcemia) \*\*

## Loop

Loop diuretics (i.e. furosemide, bumetanide, ethacrynic acid) **block the NKCC (Na+/K+/2Cl-) symporter in the thick ascending limb of the Loop of Henle.**

Loop diuretics are particularly useful in clinical settings of **volume overload** including **congestive heart failure** and **edema**.

Loop diuretic toxicities include (mnemonic ‘OHHH DANG’):

- **Ototoxicity**
- **Hypokalemia**
- **Hypocalcemia**
- **Hypomagnesemia**
- **Dehydration**
- **Allergy (sulfa – except ethacrynic acid)**
- **Nephritis (interstitial)**
- **Gout**

## K sparing

Potassium-sparing diuretics (i.e. amiloride, triameterene, spironolactone and eplerenone) act at the **collecting tubule** of the nephron.

Potassium-sparing diuretics are particularly useful as adjuvants to other diuretic medications, **especially if hypokalemia is a concern.**

Because spironolactone and eplerenone are competitive inhibitors of aldosterone receptors, they are only active in the presence of **aldosterone**.

Toxicities of **spironolactone** include:

- Hyperkalemia
- Gynecomastia
- Amenorrhea
- Other anti-androgen effects

## CA Inhibitors

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g. acetazolamide) act at the **proximal convoluted tubule** by inhibiting the production and reabsorption of filtered bicarbonate.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are rarely used in the treatment of hypertension and **more often used in the treatment of intracranial hypertension.**

Other conditions treated with acetazolamide include altitude sickness, increased intra-ocular pressure and alkalinization of urine for the treatment of renal calculi.

Toxicities of acetazolamide include:

- **Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis**
- **Hypokalemia**
- **Ammonia toxicity (due to decreased clearance)**
- **Neuropathy**
- **Sulfa allergy**

Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that **increases tubular fluid osmolarity**, thereby increasing urine flow.

Mannitol is most often used in **treatment of increased intracranial pressure.**

Mannitol toxicity includes **pulmonary edema and intravascular dehydration.**

# Metaboic Acidosis

Metabolic acidosis is defined as an **acidotic pH (< 7.37) with a _decrease_ in HCO3- levels.**

In metabolic acidosis, **look for the following general values:**
| pH   | \[H+] | \[HCO3-]  | PCO2 | Compensation     |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| low  | high | very low | low  | Hyperventilation |

Causes of metabolic acidosis are separated into two categories: **increased anion gap** and **normal anion gap**.

Anion gap calculation:

**AG (mEq/L) = \[Na+] – (\[Cl-] + \[HCO3-])**

Normal = 10-15 mEq/L

## Increased AG

Causes of anion gap metabolic acidosis include:

- Ketoacidosis (starvation, DKA, alcohol use)
- Exogenous toxins (methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylates)
- Lactic acidosis (ischemia, shock)
- Renal failure (decreased NH4+ excretion)
- Significant uremia
- Drugs: paraldehyde, isoniazid (INH)

Useful mnemonic: _MUDPILES_ (**M**ethanol, **U**remia, **D**KA, **P**araldehyde,**I**NH, **L**actic acidosis, **E**thylene glycol, **S**alicylates)

An **increased osmolol gap is suggestive of toxic alcohol ingestion** as a cause of the metabolic acidosis.

The osmolar gap should be calculated in selected cases of increased anion gap acidosis, such as when ethanol, methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity is suspected.  It is calculated by determining the difference between the measured and calculated serum osmolality.

Calculate the osmolol gap (OG) as follows:

$\[Osm]_{measured}-(2\[Na]+\frac{\[glucose]}{18}+\frac{\[Bun]}{2.8})$

\[Osm]measured is the measured serum osmolality, and \[Na], \[glucose], and \[BUN] are the measured concentrations of sodium, glucose, and BUN, respectively.

A normal OG is < 10 mOsm/kg.

## Normal AG

Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis) can be further divided into 4 categories (low aldosterone):

- **GI HCO3- loss**
- **renal acidosis**
- **drug-induced hyperkalemia with renal insufficiency**
- **and other causes**

Normal anion gap due to GI HCO3- loss is seen in:

- **Diarrhea** (most common)
- **External pancreatic or small-bowel drainage**
- **Jejunal and ileal loops**

Normal anion gap _hypokalemic_ renal acidosis is seen in:

- **Type 1 Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA)** - Failure of distal tubule cells to secrete H+ and generate new HCO3-.
	- **Drugs:** Ifosfamide, Amphotericin B
- **Type 2 RTA** - Decreased HCO3- reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule
	- **Drugs:** acetazolamide, topiramate

Normal anion gap _hyperkalemic_ renal acidosis is seen in Type 4 RTA (hypoaldosteronism).

Drug-induced hyperkalemia with renal insufficiency leading to normal anion gap metabolic acidosis is seen in:

- **Potassium-sparing diuretics (amiloride, triamterene, spironolactone)**
- **Trimethoprim**
- **ACEIs and ARBs**
- **NSAIDs**
- **Cyclosporine**

Other causes of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis include:

- **Acid loads (ammonium chloride)**
- **Expansion acidosis from rapid saline administration**
- **Hippurate**

If a patient has a normal anion gap, GI HCO3- loss can be differentiated from RTAs as potential causes by calculating the **urine anion gap** (UAG). The UAG is the difference between measured anions and cations in the urine:
UAG = \[Na]urine + \[K]urine – \[Cl-]urine

Since the major unmeasured urinary cation is NH4, a negative UAG suggests **high levels of NH4 excretion**. This is an appropriate response, suggesting **normal renal function and therefore GI loss of HCO3-**.

Conversely, a positive UAG suggests low NH4 excretion, indicating **renal tubular dysfunction**.

Compensation for metabolic acidosis can be made via the respiratory system by **hyperventilation**, causing a reduction in PCO2.

Respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis is triggered by **a drop in arterial pH, resulting in stimulation of central and peripheral chemoreceptors** controlling respiration.

To estimate the **expected PCO2 range based on respiratory compensation**, the Winter’s formula can be used. The Winter’s formula is calculated as:

**Expected PaCO2 = 1.5 (measured HCO3-) + 8 +/- 2**

If the PCO2 falls within the acceptable range, **the patient has a simple metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation.**

If the PCO2 does not measure within acceptable range, there is likely **another acid-base disorder present**.

## Treatment

The treatment of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis should focus on **correcting the underlying pathology**.

Seizures: the most appropriate management of this patient is observation and a repeat chemistry panel after approximately 2 hours. Norepinephrine acts as a positive inotrope and vasoconstrictor and is often used in patients with lactic acidosis due to hypotension and poor organ perfusion (eg, sepsis) that persists following fluid resuscitation.

Should the acid-base disturbance be acute and severe, treatment involves administration of **NaHCO3**.

It is generally recommended in patients with severe acute metabolic acidosis with pH less than 7.1.  Administration of sodium bicarbonate may cause myocardial depression and increased lactic acid production; therefore, in patients with pH >7.1

# Metabolic Alkalosis

Metabolic alkalosis is defined as a **serum pH > 7.43 with an increase in serum HCO3- levels.**

Metabolic alkalosis can be due to a **gain in HCO3-** or, more commonly, **excessive loss of H+**.

H+ loss often results from the **loss of H+ rich GI fluids** (e.g. vomiting).

Contraction alkalosis is **volume loss around a fixed amount of HCO3-**. Though the total body HCO3- levels have not changed, the concentration has and therefore the pH increases.

The kidneys have the ability to excrete very large amounts of HCO3-, so in order to maintain metabolic alkalosis there often must be impaired renal function. This can result from:

- **Decreased GFR**
- **Chloride depletion**
- **Volume contraction**
- **Hypokalemia**

The ability to secrete HCO3- in the kidneys depends on the countertransport of Cl-. In hypochloremia, the decrease in filtered Cl- is sensed by the macula densa, **resulting in a decrease in filtered HCO3- and increased aldosterone release**, both of which worsen the alkalosis. Cases of metabolic alkalosis are often described as chloride responsive or chloride unresponsive (see below).

In metabolic alkalosis, expect to see the following values:
| pH       | \[H+]    | \[HCO3-]       | PCO2     | Compensation        |
| -------- | ------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| **High** | **Low** | **Very High** | **High** | **Hypoventilation** |

Urine \[Cl-] < 10 mEq/L suggests **chloride responsive** metabolic alkalosis as well as volume depletion, and urine \[Cl-] > 20 mEq/L suggests **chloride unresponsive** metabolic alkalosis.

Urine \[K+] is normally **low** in metabolic alkalosis.

Signs and symptoms of metabolic alkalosis are similar to those of hypocalcemia:

- \*\*Confusion \*\*
- **Paresthesias**
- **Tetany**
- **Muscle cramping**
- **Seizures**
- **Arrhythmias**

There are also often signs and symptoms of **hypovolemia**, since volume contraction results in many causes of metabolic alkalosis (vomiting, diuretic use).

### Treatment

Chloride _responsive_ metabolic alkalosis is treated with saline, which results in **increased filtered chloride and increased HCO3- secretion**.

Chloride _unresponsive_ metabolic alkalosis does not respond to saline.

Hypokalemia potentiates alkalosis of any cause. Correcting the **hypokalemia** is necessary to adequately treat the alkalosis.

**Acetazolamide** is used if saline administration and correcting the hypokalemia fails to resolve the metabolic alkalosis.

If alkalemia is severe (pH > 7.70) with hypervolemia, **HCl can be administered through a central line.**

# Pyelonephritis

Pyelonephritis is an infection of the kidneys. The most common infectious agent is **_E. coli_**.

Less common pathogens include:

- **_Klebsiella_**
- **_S. saprophyticus_**
- **_Proteus_**
- **_Candida_** (in immunocompromised patients)

Pyelonephritis generally occurs from an **ascending infection**, **beginning in the lower urinary tract**.

Risk factors for the development of pyelonephritis include:

- **Urinary tract obstruction**
- **Frequent sexual intercourse**
- **A new sexual partner**
- **Spermicide use**
- **Previous history of pyelonephritis**
- **Immunocompromised status**

Symptoms consistent with pyelonephritis include:

- **Flank pain**
- **Costovertebral tenderness**
- **Urinary symptoms** (**frequency**, **dysuria**, **urgency**)
- **Chills**
- **Nausea**,**vomiting**
- **Fever**

On urine microscopy, pyelonephritis will cause **white blood cell casts** and **10^5 bacteria/mL of urine**.

Other lab findings include **elevated WBCs, ESR, and C-reactive protein**.

Pregnant women with pyelonephritis are at an **increased risk of preterm labor and delivering a low birth weight baby.**

## Treatment

For less severe/uncomplicated cases of pyelonephritis, the treatment is **1-2 days of IV fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, or 3rd generation cephalosporins**, **followed by oral antibiotics**.

For cases of complicated pyelonephritis (i.e. in pregnancy, diabetes, obstruction, renal failure, etc.), **patients may require 2-3 weeks of IV antibiotics.**

# DI

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a leading cause of euvolemic hypernatremia.  It typically presents with severe polyuria and mild hypernatremia.  It can be divided into two types based on urine osmolality, as well as etiology.

Based on urine osmolality, DI may be complete or partial.

1. Complete DI - the urine osmolality is less than 300 mOsm/kg (often less than 100 mOsm/kg)
2. Partial DI - urine osmolality ranges from 300-600 mOsm/kg.

The serum osmolality is elevated in both types.

Based on etiology, DI may be central or nephrogenic.

1. Central DI is due to decreased production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH).  Common causes include trauma, hemorrhage, infection, and tumors.
2. Nephrogenic DI results from renal ADH resistance.  Common causes include hypercalcemia, severe hypokalemia, tubulointerstitial renal disease, and medications.  The most commonly implicated mediations are lithium, demeclocycline, foscarnet, cidofovir, and amphotericin.

## Treatment

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/L15445.jpg)

The first step is to restore volume with isotonic fluids (0.9% saline).  Isotonic fluid is not usually used in hypernatremia, but it is recommended in patients with marked volume depletion and hemodynamic instability.  Once the patient is euvolemic, the fluid can be switched to a hypotonic fluid (5% dextrose preferred over 0.45% saline) for free water supplementation.  The serum sodium should be corrected by 0.5 mEq/dL/hr without exceeding 12 mEq/dL/24 hr.  Cerebral edema can occur if the sodium is corrected too quickly.
