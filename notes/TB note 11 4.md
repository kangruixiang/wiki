# TB note 11 4

- related: [[Tuberculosis]]

## Spread

- mostly from cough/airdrop
	- only 10 bacilli need to reach lung
- very rarely genitourinary

## Pathogenesis

- phagocytosed by macrophage
- antigen produce **cellular** instead of B cell response, CD 4 and 8
- One of 2 outcomes
	- Latent: infection contained not eliminated. Granulomas
	- Active: not contained, spreads

## Latent

- asymptomatic and not contagious
- 5% risk of reactivation first 1.5 years and then 5% risk lifetime reactivation

## Active

- Sx of fever, night sweats, weight loss caused by TNF alpha immune response
- hemoptysis: cellular destruction and necrosis from immune response
- Advanced HIV pts can have nl CXR
- Other sx:
	- could be any organ sx or part of body
	- meningitis
	- hepatitis
	- spine, Pott's
	- lymph
	- pericardium

## Latent TB Dx

- Asymptomatic tests if:
	- from endemic and/or exposure
	- health care worker
	- immunocompromised condition, HIV
- TB skin test
	- 5mm: HIV, organ transplant, immunocompromised
	- 15mm: no risks
- Interferon gamma release assay: T cell response to TB ag in latent TB
	- NIL: negative control, patient's blood not with any antigens, < 8 iu/ml. If higher then underlying inflammatory condition that causes false positive
	- mitogen: positive control. Pt's blood with nonspecific activation of T cells, > 0.5. False negative can happen if < 0.5
	- TB-NIL: TB antigen minus negative control
	- Indeterminate: either negative or positive control failed. Test didn't work.

## Active TB Dx

- Do not order IGRA or skin test.
- Sputum:
	- 3 AFB smears, 8 hours apart: immediately. Infectious if positive, but only noninfectious if negative. Can still have TB
		- non TB mycobacterium can stain positive
		- nocardia can stain positive
	- culture for M.TB
	- NAAT DNA probe, PCR: can also look for rifampin, INH resistance
- CXR and CT
	- high sensitivity for active TB
	- low specificity 60-70%
	- HIV pt can have unremarkable CXR
- Bronchoscopy:
	- bronc x1 has lower sensitivity than sputum x3
	- helpful if pt cannot produce sputum

## Treatment

- Prior to treatment
	- screen HIV
	- CXR
    Latent:
- INH 9 months with B6
- rifampin 4 months: can have more drug drug interactions
- INH and rifapentin 3 months
- Follow monthly
- Ask about: nausea, anorexia, icterus, rash, paresthesia
- monitor ALT, AST, T bili (inh rifampin cause hepatitis)
- watchout out >3x upper limit of nl LFT

Active:

- RIPE: 4 drugs 2 months, and then 4 months INH/rifampin
- extend therapy if sputum clx positive after 2 months. Continue 7 months
- extrapulmonary: 9-12 months

## MDR TB

- MDR if resistance to INH and rifampin
- extensively drug resistance: INH, R, fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside
