# rhabdomyolysis

<!-- rhabdomyolysis ua -->

This patient with a seizure from phencyclidine (PCP) has urinalysis evidence of blood with minimal  red blood cells, raising suspicion for **myoglobinuria** due to **rhabdomyolysis**.

Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by the release of intracellular muscle components into the circulation after muscular injury. Most cases arise due to trauma, compression injury, infection, drug use (eg, PCP), or toxin exposure.  Diagnosis is typically made when laboratory results show **markedly elevated creatine kinase** levels (usually >10,000 U/L). Urinalysis often reveals **blood with no red blood cells**, indicating myoglobinuria.
