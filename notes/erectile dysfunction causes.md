Most men with **end-stage renal disease** (ESRD) experience **sexual dysfunction**.  Manifestations can include low libido, erectile dysfunction, decreased frequency of intercourse, and infertility.  Sexual dysfunction in ESRD is usually **multifactorial**.  Common contributing factors include vascular/vasoactive impairment, peripheral and autonomic neuropathy, gonadal dysfunction, psychological stress, concurrent medications, and medical comorbidities.

The initial evaluation of sexual dysfunction in patients with ESRD should include a clinical review for possible contributing factors (eg, medications, vascular disease) and limited laboratory testing (eg, serum testosterone, prolactin levels).  Most patients with erectile dysfunction respond to **phosphodiesterase inhibitors** (eg, sildenafil).  This patient's normal nonsexual morning erections suggest a possible psychogenic component, but this is unlikely to be the only factor in a patient with ESRD, and the effectiveness of psychotherapy for sexual dysfunction in men with ESRD is unknown.
