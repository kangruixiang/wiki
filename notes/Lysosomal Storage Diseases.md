# Lysosomal Storage Diseases

![](https://i.imgur.com/aPTmH4X.jpg)

- vacuum cleaners of the cell

![](https://i.imgur.com/camgLzX.jpg)

- child born without enzymes

# Sphingosines

![](https://i.imgur.com/KnDj0CN.jpg)

- most diseases are ceramide derivative, all contain sphingosine, and are all sphingolipids

![](https://i.imgur.com/LF1sSnn.jpg)

- hepatosplenomegaly

## Fabry's

![](https://i.imgur.com/xA9f5Xs.jpg)

- most are autosomal recessive
- lives well into 30s-50s

- biggest problem, pain

- later
- restrictive cardiomyopathy

![](https://i.imgur.com/rIisgLt.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/knnJitz.jpg)

- accumulate in vascular endothelial cells

## Gaucher

![](https://i.imgur.com/WyqLnO8.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/W4tDJRW.jpg)

- liver/spleen affected: macrophages live here
- avascular necrosis: ischemia of joints (large macrophages filled with sphingolipids obstruct vessels supplying joints)

![](https://i.imgur.com/XNOs51r.jpg)

- similar path with sickle cell: abnormal large cells clog up vasculatures

![](https://i.imgur.com/qYxp4hl.jpg)

- minimal CNS
- normal lifespan from enzyme replacement

## Niemann-Pick

![](https://i.imgur.com/tzpr3kJ.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/UeoTmB6.jpg)

- CNS symptoms more often than Gaucher

![](https://i.imgur.com/KHFAIRN.jpg)

- macrophages

![](https://i.imgur.com/p3g9xmj.jpg)

- central artery occlusion: never in children

![](https://i.imgur.com/3Vw6Mrl.jpg)

- liver/spleen not part of Tay Sack disease

## Krabbe

![](https://i.imgur.com/GPq12gl.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/F9FtvJu.jpg)

- present very young
- only neuro, no liver, spleen

![](https://i.imgur.com/1yMgbzG.jpg)

# Gangliosides

![](https://i.imgur.com/DIJn9nk.jpg)

- family of sphingolipids, gangliosides related
- neuro deficits

## Tay Sach

![](https://i.imgur.com/BtXBx3Z.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/fh3z6vc.jpg)

- eventually vegetative state and death

![](https://i.imgur.com/997LiNK.jpg)

## Metachromatic Leukodystrophy

![](https://i.imgur.com/MKNeFgw.jpg)

- similar to Krabbe because both related to myelin
- sofa, falling, sulfatides

![](https://i.imgur.com/1yLDDKe.jpg)

- sulfatides take up different colors
- similar symptoms with Krabbe

![](https://i.imgur.com/goXMIQH.jpg)

- Fabry and Gaucher: no weakness, both have enzyme replacement therapy, long life span
- Krabbe, Tay Sach: present as baby

# Glycosaminoglycans

![](https://i.imgur.com/hWuzRuR.jpg)

- repeating sets of 2 sugar molecules

![](https://i.imgur.com/9C3qCNA.jpg)

- both contain L-iduronate

![](https://i.imgur.com/FD8hWQU.jpg)

## Hurler's

![](https://i.imgur.com/HJIMRad.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/qCosdJF.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/phUcYNJ.jpg)

- abnormal mucopolysaccharides: thick secretions

## Hunter's

![](https://i.imgur.com/o3ggf2J.jpg)

- x linked recessive
- no corneal clouding
- behavior problems

# I-Cell

![](https://i.imgur.com/D13aiww.jpg)

- accumulation of both

![](https://i.imgur.com/KGARQgZ.jpg)

- synthesized normally, problem with processing

# Pompe
