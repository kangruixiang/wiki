This patient presents with non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which can be caused by numerous agents.  Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, including ==acetazolamide== (used for glaucoma) and ==topiramate== (used for seizures and migraine headaches), typically cause bicarbonate diuresis with resultant non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.  Many of the other implicated agents cause mild forms of renal tubular acidosis with accompanying non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, sometimes due to interstitial nephritis.
