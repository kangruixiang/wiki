# parvo b19

- related: [[Pediatric]]

**Erythema infectiosum**, or fifth disease, is a common, benign childhood illness caused by **parvovirus B19**.  Presentation begins with a **nonspecific prodrome** (eg, malaise, congestion, cough, fever), followed by an erythematous rash on the cheeks after initial symptoms have resolved.  This "slapped-cheek" rash can be described as **facial flushing**, as in this patient, and usually spares the nasolabial folds.  A lacy, reticular rash then follows, spreading over the trunk and extremities and sparing the palms and soles.  Diagnosis is clinical.  Erythema infectiosum is self-limited, and treatment is supportive.

Parvovirus B19 can also cause arthritis in adults and a transient aplastic crisis in those with underlying hematologic disorders (eg, sickle cell disease).
