# 23 Transplant

<!-- heart transplant indications.. -->

Heart transplantation is performed on patients with end-stage heart failure or severe coronary artery disease. Indications for heart transplant include:

- **Severe cardiac disability on maximal medical therapy**
- **Symptomatic ischemia or recurrent ventricular arrhythmia on maximum medical therapy, with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%**
- **Unstable angina and not a candidate for CABG or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty**

<!-- heart transplant matching depends on, CI.. -->

Donor matching is based on several donor-recipient compatibilities including:

- **ABO compatibility**
- **Body size**
- **Weight similarity**

Contraindications for heart transplantation include:

- **Pulmonary hypertension**
- **Smoking tobacco within six months**
- **COPD**

<!-- heart transplant type of rejection, diagnosis how.. -->

**Acute rejection** is the most common form of rejection following heart transplantation.

Rejection is diagnosed and conﬁrmed by **endomyocardial biopsy via the right internal jugular vein.**

<!-- heart transplant complications.. -->

The complications of heart transplantation include:

- **Infection**
- **Pulmonary hypertension**
- **Graft failure**

# Lung Transplant

<!-- ignore.. -->

Lung transplantation is performed on patients with **end-stage lung disease who are refractory to all other available medical treatments, most commonly secondary to:**

- **COPD**
- **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis**
- **Cystic fibrosis**
- **Primary pulmonary hypertension**
- **α1-antitrypsin deficiency**

<!-- lung transplant compatibility, CI.. -->

Donor-recipient compatibility for lung transplantation is based upon several criteria:

- **ABO compatibility**
- **Pulmonary gas exchange**
- **No smoking history**
- **Similar donor-recipient lung volumes**

Contraindications for lung transplantation include:

- **Smoking within six months**
- **Cardiac, renal, or hepatic failure**
- **HIV**
- **Terminal illness**

<!-- lung transplant type of rejection, diagnosis how.. -->

**Chronic rejection** is the most common form of rejection following lung transplantation.

Rejection is **confirmed by biopsy through bronchoscopy** and has several findings including:

- **Fever**
- **Dyspnea**
- **Decreased PaO2**
- **Decreased FEV1**
- **Chest x-ray demonstrating interstitial infiltrate**

<!-- ignore.. -->

Complications following lung transplantation include:

- **Infection**
- **Rejection**

# Immunosuppression

All patients receiving allografts require immunosuppressive therapy. The only exception is **recipients of a transplanted organ from an identical monozygotic twin** (isograft).

Most immunosuppressive agents covered in this topic are used in _maintenance therapy_ to prevent **acute rejection** of the graft.

Immunosuppressive agents carry a complex array of morbidities. The most important morbidities to broadly associate with the various immunosuppressive agents are **nephrotoxicity**, **myelosuppression,** and **metabolic syndrome**.

Glucocorticoids suppress B and T cell function and inhibit the release of IL-1 from macrophages. **Prednisone** is the most commonly used glucocorticoid used in transplantation.

The adverse effects of glucocorticoids include:

- **Cushing syndrome**
- **Cataracts**
- **Dyspepsia**
- **Osteonecrosis**
- **Acne**
- **Glucose intolerance**

Cyclosporine (CsA, Sandimmune, Neoral, Gengraf) is a **calcineurin inhibitor** that binds cyclophilin and **inhibits the secretion and formation of IL-2**.

Tacrolimus (FK506, Prograf) is a **calcineurin inhibitor** that binds FK506 binding protein (FKBP\*\*)\*\* and **inhibits the secretion and formation of IL-2** and other cytokines. It is the most commonly used calcineurin inhibitor in immunosuppressive drug regimens.

In contrast to cyclosporine (another commonly-used calcineurin inhibitor), tacrolimus exhibits less severe **androgenic effects**.

Azathioprine (Imuran) is an antimetabolite precursor of 6-mercaptopurine, which **inhibits nucleotide synthesis**. It is being replaced with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, CellCept).

Sirolimus or rapamycin (Rapamune) exhibits a unique molecular target by **inhibiting mTOR** (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) by **complexing with FKBP to inhibit T-cell proliferation**.

**Sirolimus** is unique for exhibiting minimal nephrotoxicity.

Muromonab-CD3 (Orthoclone OKT3) is a **monoclonal antibody that depletes the T-cell population**.

Muromonab-CD3 can induce a **one-time cytokine release** (fever, bronchospasm) upon use. It can only be used in short-term therapy.

# Kidney Transplant

\*\*Kidney transplantation \*\*is the most common solid organ to be transplanted.

There are multiple causes of end stage renal disease that may warrant transplantation including:

- **Diabetes**
- **Hypertension**
- **Glomerular nephritis**
- **Congenital urologic anomalies**
- **Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis**

Existing kidneys are NOT removed due to increased rates of surgical morbidity. The donated kidney is usually placed in the iliac fossa (pelvis).

**Left kidney** is preferred as a donor because it has a longer renal vein (remember the inferior vena cava is on the right side of the body, so the left kidney needs a longer vein).

<!-- kidney transplant early, late complications.. -->

Early complications of kidney transplant include oliguria or anuria that may result from **graft thrombosis** or **urine leak.**

Late complications of kidney transplant include **ureteral stricture (↑ creatinine)** and **arteriosclerosis of the renal artery**.

# Pancreas Transplant

<!-- pancreas transplant when, CI.. -->

Pancreas transplantation is performed on individuals with **type 1 diabetes with end-stage renal disease** (majority of these are simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantations).

**Type II diabetes** is a contraindication to pancreas transplantation.

# Liver Transplant

<!-- ignore.. -->

There are multiple causes of liver failure that are indications for transplantation:

- **Chronic hepatitis B**
- **Chronic hepatitis C**
- **Alcoholic sclerosis**
- **Biliary disease** - primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, biliary atresia
- **Wilson disease**

<!-- liver transplant CI.. -->

Absolute contraindications for liver transplantation include:

- **Active drug or alcohol abuse**
- **Uncontrolled metastatic cancer outside liver**
- **Hepatocellular carcinoma with metastases**
- **Active systemic infection**

**Individuals with hepatitis B or C** may be used as donors for patients with the same infection if there is no organ damage detected in the donor liver.

# Transplant Selections

<!-- organ donors selection, compatibility selection.. -->

Organ transplant donors are most commonly **brain-dead or living voluntary donors without cancer, sepsis, or organ insufficiency**. HIV is no longer an absolute contraindication for transplantation; patients with a well-controlled HIV infection are eligible.

Selection of organ transplant donors is based on the following criteria:

- **ABO blood group compatibility**
- **Cross match compatibility** (i.e. antidonor antibodies on recipient T cells)
- **HLA antigen matching**

HLA antigen matching is **more significant** for **pancreas** and **kidney** transplants and less significant for **heart** and **liver**.

<!-- organs with infection can be transplanted?.. -->

Organs from individuals with a specific infection (e.g. hepatitis) with **no significant organ damage** may be transplanted into a **recipient with the same infection**.

# Transplant Rejection

<!-- 3 types of transplant rejection, time, pathogenesis, treatment.. -->

The three types of transplant rejection are:

- **Hyperacute**
- **Acute**
- **Chronic**

Hyperacute transplant rejection occurs **immediately or within hours (< 24 hours)** of the transplantation.

**Preformed recipient antibodies against donor tissue**, usually directed toward ABO blood group or HLA antigens, mediate the reaction leading to vascular thrombosis and necrosis. Histologically, the predominant cell infiltrate of hyperacute transplant rejection is **polymorphonuclear leukocytes**.

Hyperacute transplant rejection is **untreatable**, but rarely occurs due to **cross-matching** and **blood group matching**.

Acute transplant rejection usually occurs **7-10 days** after transplantation, but may occur up to a year.

**Antidonor T-cells proliferate in the recipient** and mediate the reaction leading to mononuclear infiltration into vascular and interstitial spaces. For this reason, histologically, the predominant cell infiltrate of acute transplant rejection is **monocyte/macrophage**.

Acute transplant rejection is treated with **intravenous steroids** (e.g. **methylprednisolone**) and is **frequently reversible**. If reversed, the graft has a good prognosis.

Chronic transplant rejection occurs **years after transplantation**.

The pathogenesis of chronic transplant rejection is poorly understood, but is **mediated by both cellular and humoral immune reactions**. The donor tissue is characterized by **vascular intimal hyperplasia** and **lymphocytic infiltration**.

There is **no effective treatment** for chronic transplant rejection.
