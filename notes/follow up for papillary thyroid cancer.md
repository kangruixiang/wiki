This patient has a low risk for recurrent thyroid cancer due to young age (< 45 years) and small (< 4 cm) nonmetastatic tumor.  Papillary thyroid cancer is the most common type of thyroid cancer and usually recurs in the neck.  The prognosis is usually very good in small tumors without high-risk features (eg, vascular invasion, more aggressive histologic subtypes, or poorly differentiated histologies on pathology).  Most cancers require initial thyroidectomy and post-surgical radioiodine therapy.  Thyroglobulin is secreted by most differentiated thyroid cancers (papillary and follicular) and is a useful marker of persistent or recurrent tumor after thyroidectomy and radioablation of normal thyroid tissue.  Undetectable thyroglobulin in treated thyroid cancer patients signifies absent disease.

Follow-up surveillance (Table) includes serial TSH, free T4, and thyroglobulin measurements.  Neck ultrasound is recommended twice initially in the first year after cancer treatment and then every 1-3 years or less frequently in low-risk patients.  Diagnostic radioiodine scan is recommended for elevated thyroglobulin.  This patient has been followed for 3 years without evidence of residual thyroid cancer.  Her symptoms are nonspecific, and she first needs serum TSH, free T4, and thyroglobulin to assess for recurrent thyroid cancer **(Choice C)**.  If thyroglobulin is elevated, she may require further testing, including neck ultrasound and diagnostic radioiodine scan **(Choices B and D)**.
