Hyperglycemia causes the osmotic translocation of water from the ==intracellular to the extracellular fluid compartment, which results in a decrease in the serum sodium level== by approximately 1.6 to 2.0 mEq/L (1.6-2.0 mmol/L) for every 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) increase in the plasma glucose above 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L). Although the patient has mild hyperglycemia, her glucose is not elevated enough to lower her sodium to 126 mEq/L (126 mmol/L).
