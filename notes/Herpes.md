# Herpes

<!-- Herpes Simplex Virus morphology, family -->

**Icosahedral, enveloped** capsid virus with **linear double-stranded DNA** (dsDNA). Is part of the Herpesviridae family..

<!-- HSV types and infected locations -->

Includes two types, HSV-1 and HSV-2. **HSV-1 typically infects above the waist** and **HSV-2 typically infects below the waist**. Infections from HSV-1 and HSV-2 can each be seen both above and below the waist, possibly due to **oral sex practices**..

<!-- HSV skin association -->

Associated with **erythema multiforme**, which appears as a "target lesion" with a pink-red ring around a pale center.

appear 1-2 weeks after infection

## HSV-1

<!-- HSV-1 Transmission -->

is transmitted through **respiratory secretions and saliva** and is typically involved with **infections above the waist**..

<!-- HSV-1 symptoms -->

When the virus invades the mucous membranes, the infection is typically asymptomatic but can cause vesicular lesions that can ulcerate and cause..

- **Gingivostomatitis** in the mouth is the most common.
- **Keratoconjunctivities** on the cornea, typically presenting as a branching “dendritic ulcer.”
- **Esophagitis with ulcers** that appear well-circumscribed and have a “volcano-like” appearance. Often seen in immunocompromised individuals (ie. organ and bone marrow transplant recipients). CMV: linear
- red lips, red eyes,

.

Primary infection with HSV-1 results in herpetic **gingivostomatitis**.  Peak age for primary infection is age 6 months to 5 years.  Prodromal symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, chills) begin approximately 1 week after contact with an infected person (who is generally asymptomatic).  Painful **vesicles** appear, extensively covering the lips and gingiva, and may include the palate, tongue, or oropharynx.  The vesicles organize into extensive ulcers and resolve within 1-2 weeks.  The pain of gingivostomatitis often results in**dehydration**, the most common reason for hospitalization.

<!-- HSV1 latent and result -->

Primary infection resolves after 2-3 weeks and can enter local sensory nerve endings and through axonal transport the virus can become latent in **trigeminal ganglion** or other sensory ganglia. Stress can cause **viral reactivation** and can results in **herpetic labialis (cold sores around the mouth)**, gingivostomatitis, or keratoconjunctivitis..

<!-- HSV-1 CNS symptoms -->

Can spread via cranial nerves to the brain and cause **focal necrotic lesion in the temporal lobe, causing inflammation and encephalitis**. Most common cause of sporadic encephalitis, and can present with

- **Altered mental status**
- **Seizures**
- **Aphasia** (loss of ability to understand/express speech)..

<!-- HSV hand lesions name and demographics -->

**Herpetic whitlow** is a painful hand vesicle that can occur in healthcare workers who come in contact with herpetic lesions (ie. dental procedure)..

## HSV-2

<!-- HSV2 transmission -->

Through **sexual contact** and is typically involved with **infections below the waist**..

<!-- HSV2 symptoms -->

When the virus invades the mucous membranes, the infection is typically asymptomatic but can cause vesicular lesions that can cause **genital herpes** and painful inguinal lymphadenopathy..

Incubation: 3-7 days

<!-- HSV2 latent in -->

Primary infection resolves after 2-3 weeks and can enter local sensory nerve endings and through axonal transport the virus can become latent in the **lumbosacral ganglia** or other sensory ganglia..

## Congenital Herpes

<!-- Herpes congenital transmission and symptoms -->

Vertical transmission can occur through the placenta (intrauterine HSV) or during delivery (neonatal HSV). Neonatal HSV can be classified into three main categories:

- **Skin, eye, and mouth**

- **CNS disease**

- **Disseminated disease**..

## Torch infections

<!-- Torch infections -->

Congenital infections..

- **To**xoplasma
- **R**ubella
- **C**MV
- **He**rpes simplex, **H**IV
- **S**yphilis

<!-- HSV diagnosis -->

Diagnosis includes:

- PCR, especially in early detection of encephalitis

- Multinucleate giant cells on **Tzanck** smear of skin lesions

- Eosinophilic **Cowdry** intranuclear inclusion bodies..

<!-- HSV treatment -->

Treatment includes **acyclovir for only active infections**, since HSV thymidine kinase and DNA polymerase are not made during latency..

Acyclovir-resistant HSV can be treated with **foscarnet** because it bypasses activation by deficient or mutated thymidine kinase.
