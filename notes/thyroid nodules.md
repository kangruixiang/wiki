Patients with thyroid nodules >1 cm should be evaluated based on their cancer risk factors (eg, family history, past radiation exposure, cervical  lymphadenopathy), compressive symptoms (eg, hoarseness, difficulty  swallowing), and thyroid functional status (ie, euthyroid, hyperthyroid, or hypothyroid). In general, an **ultrasound of the thyroid** should be obtained first. Patients with suspicious ultrasound findings (eg, hypoechoic, microcalcifications, internal vascularity) or cancer  risk factors should undergo **fine-needle aspiration (FNA)**. Measurement of serum **TSH** can further stratify the risk of malignancy in patients with a thyroid  nodule. Patients with normal or elevated TSH levels have a higher risk  of malignancy and should be evaluated with FNA.

Patients with low TSH levels should be evaluated using thyroid scintigraphy, usually with iodine 123.  A hyperfunctioning ("hot") nodule (increased isotope uptake in the  nodule with decreased surrounding uptake) is rarely malignant and may be treated as benign hyperthyroidism. An indeterminate or hypofunctioning ("cold") nodule indicates a higher risk of cancer and requires further  evaluation with FNA.

This patient has a painless  thyroid nodule without clinical risk factors for thyroid cancer,  compressive symptoms, or features suggesting hyper- or hypothyroidism.  However, due to the size of the nodule and normal TSH level, this  patient should have FNA to rule out malignancy.
