# euglycemic ketoacidosis

<!-- euglycemic DKA cause, sx -->

This patient has acute anion gap metabolic acidosis associated with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  In light of the positive urine ketone screen, this most likely represents **euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis** (euDKA), a recognized complication of **sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor** (eg, canagliflozin) therapy.

SGLT2 inhibitors lower blood glucose by reducing reabsorption of glucose in the kidney, which leads to a low insulin-to-glucagon ratio because high blood glucose levels are the primary stimulus for insulin release.  euDKA in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors can be triggered by prolonged **fasting**, major illness, intense exercise, excessive alcohol intake, or an abrupt reduction in concurrent insulin dose.  These conditions further lower the insulin-to-glucagon ratio and exacerbate relative insulin deficiency to the point of stimulating ketogenesis.

In contrast to typical DKA, which is associated with very high glucose levels, blood glucose in SGLT2-associated euDKA is usually **<250 mg/dL** due to the increased excretion of glucose in the urine.  Management includes aggressive hydration, discontinuation of the drug, and control of blood glucose with insulin.
