## pRBC

- content:
	- packed RBC with small amount of plasma
	- HCT level of 55-65%

## Plasma

- content: coagulation factors, albumin, Igs, plasma proteins
- indication: restore multiple coagulation factors (DIC)
- FFP: frozen within 6 hours of collection, shelf life 1 year frozen, 24 hours after thawed, then has 5 days of storage
- FFP: all soluble plasma proteins + clotting factors. Poor source of fibrinogen

## Cryoprecipitate

- content:
	- when FFP thawed, small amount of plasma that precipitates
	- **fibrinogen**, factor 8, factor 13, vWF
- indication:
	- mostly hypofibrinogenemia, such as DIC. Fibrinogen < 100 mg/d
	- uremic bleeding
- dosing: 5-10 units (from multiple donors pooled together)

## Platelets

- content:
	- platelet in plasma
	- half life 5 days
- dosing:
	- platelet concentration: from whole blood donation
	- platelets collected from aphresis: dosing equals 4-6u platelet concentrates, raises plt by 20-25k

## Plasma Derivatives

- plasma pooled from thousands of donors and fractionated into different derivatives:
	- albumin
	- Ig
	- Rh Ig
	- coagulation factor concentrates: factor 8
- recombinant factor concentrates: not containing any donor plasma. Used for younger patients with hemophilia (factor 8 and 9)
- Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC):
	- factor 2, 7, 9, 10
	- preferred product for bleed while on warfarin
	- only use for life threatening bleed because risk of thrombosis, do not just give for elevated INR
	- carries residual heparin, CI in HIT
- 3 factor PCC: factor 2, 9, 10
- 4 factor PCC: 2, 7, 9, 10
- Activated PCC (Feiba): factor 2, **7a**, 9, 10

## Tranexamic acid and aminocaproid acid

- tranexamic acid (Lysteda): inhibits fibrinolysis by forming complex that displaces plasminogen from fibrin. Inhibits plasmin
- aminocaproic acid (Amicar): binds competitively to plasminogen and blocks binding to fibrin
