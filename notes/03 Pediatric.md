Gilbert syndrome is a **hereditary, chronic or recurrent, mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia** with otherwise normal liver function tests.

This syndrome is the result of a defective promoter _UGT1A1_ gene encoding for the **bilirubin uridine diphosphoglucoronate-glucuronosyltransferase (bilirubin-UGT)**

The result is the **inability to conjugate bilirubin** with glucuronic acid.

The syndrome is relatively common, **affecting between 4-16% people**.

Gilbert syndrome is **more commonly diagnosed in males**.

Most patients with Gilbert syndrome are **asymptomatic**.

When symptomatic, patients with Gilbert syndrome present with **episodes of intermittent mild jaundice**.

Often patients are first identified **by an elevated serum bilirubin on routine blood chemistry** or mild jaundice (perhaps only scleral icterus) during a period of fasting associated with viral illness or rigorous activities.

Generally, a diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome can be made **when there is a mild, fluctuating unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia**, otherwise normal liver function tests and no hemolysis.

Gilbert syndrome is generally believed to have no significant negative health implications and **treatment is generally not required**.

Patients with Gilbert syndrome may be more susceptible to toxicity of drugs that require metabolism through glucuronidation, such as:

- **Irinotecan**
- **Acetaminophen**
- **Tolbutamide**
