This patient’s presentation is consistent with ==Morton's neuroma== ==(interdigital nerve compression)==.  This condition is common in ==women== who wear ==high-heeled shoes==, ==runners==, and people with ==flat feet==.  Repetitive injury leads to painful ==enlargement== of the ==plantar digital nerve== between the metatarsal heads.  Patients complain of ==numbness and burning pain==.  Pain is located along the plantar aspect of the forefoot, usually between the ==3rd and 4th metatarsals==.

The diagnosis of Morton neuroma is primarily made clinically.  On examination, ==squeezing the metatarsal joints== will cause pain on the plantar surface of the foot along with crepitus between the third and fourth toes (Mulder sign).

Treatment involves conservative measures such as ==orthotic footwear== (metatarsal support with a bar or padded shoe inserts to decrease pressure on the metatarsal heads) and ==NSAIDs==.  ==Corticosteroid injections== can be used for symptomatic relief in patients who fail conservative measures.  ==Surgical excision== can be performed for patients who fail all such therapy and remain symptomatic after 1 year.
