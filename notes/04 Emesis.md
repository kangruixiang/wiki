# 04 Emesis

<!-- Baby emesis is, timeframe, 3 causes.. -->

Baby Emesis: projectile vomitting because of obstruction on **day 0**

- Normal feeding: not projectile, formula colored, occurs after eating
- Bilious: projectile, green, distal to biliary tree and ligament of treiz
- Non-bilious: projectile, not green

# Bilious

<!-- bilious emesis causes.. -->

- malrotation
- duodenal atresia
- annular pancreas
- intestinal atresia

## Malrotation

<!-- malrotation path, pt, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

- path: failure of rotation, strangulation, obstruction, vascular ischemia
- pt: normal pregnancy, normal uterine course, non polyhydramnio or Down syndrome. **Bilious** vomitting
- diagnosis
	- x-ray, double bubble. Normal gas pattern distal (happens late, chance for air to get into bowel)
	- upper GI series to confirm obstruction
- treatment
	- conservative manage
	- NG tube: decompress
	- surgery to cure, especially if volvulus

## Duodenal Atresia

<!-- duodenal atresia path, pt, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

- path: failure to recanulize. Blood flow is good. Making urine but not swallowing. Polyhydramnio
- pt: polydydramnios. Down syndrome. Biliary emesis
- diagnosis: (babygram) xray, double bubble, no gas beyond (too early for air to get in)
- treatment: surgery

## Annular Pancreas

<!-- annular pancreas path, pt, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

- path: pancreas encircle duodenum. Failure of apoptosis
- pt: polyhydramnios, biliary emesis, down
- diagnosis: xray double bubble and no gas
- treatment: surgery

## Intestinal Atresia

<!-- intestinal atresia path, pt, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

- path: vascular accidents in utero. Vasospasm cut off blood supply. Atresia
- pt: mom does vasoconstrictor (cocaine). Maybe polyhydramnios (happens late). No Downs association
- diagnosis: xray double bubble, multiple air fluid levels (happens in multiple segments simultaneously). Each atretic = air fluid
- treatment
	- surgery, short gut
	- confront mom, prevent happening on next child

# Nonbilous

<!-- nonbilious emesis includes.. -->

- TE fistula
- pyloric stenosis

## Tracheoesophageal Fistula

<!-- TE fistula most common type, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

Many types. Most common type: blind pouch, fistula:

- Food goes to blind pouch, spill into lungs.
- symptoms: nonbiliary emesis, **gurgling, bubbling out of mouth** (breathing through gastric secretions)
- diagnosis: NG tube that coils in blind pouch on X-ray
- treatment: parenteral, prepare for surgery reconnect

## Pyloric Stenosis

<!-- pyloric stenosis path, pt, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

- path: hypertrophy of pylorus, gastric outlet obstruction
- pt: male, 2-8 weeks, normal feeds going to projectile, nonbilious vomitting
- diagnosis
	- olive shaped mass, visible peristaltic waves
	- US, donut sign
	- CMP: hypoCl, hypoK, high bicarb, metabolic alkalosis
- treatment
	- correct electrolyte with IVF first
	- pyloromyotomy
