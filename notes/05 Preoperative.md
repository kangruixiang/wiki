# 05 Preoperative

<!-- ignore.. -->

An initial estimate of perioperative cardiac risk is calculated with the **revised Goldman cardiac risk index (RCRI)**, which is based on the following 6 independent predictors:

- **High risk surgery** (intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, vascular)
- **History of ischemic heart disease** (MI within a month)
- **History of congestive heart failure**
- **History of cerebrovascular disease**
- **Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin treatment**
- **Pre-operative creatinine >2.0 mg/dL**

| **Total Points**           | **Risk of Peri-operative Cardiac Complications for noncardiac surgery** |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Zero risk factors          | 0.4%                                     |
| One risk factor            | 0.9%                                     |
| Two risk factors           | 6.6%                                     |
| Three or more risk factors | 11.0%                                    |

Patients with \*\*a score of 1 or 0 on RCRI \*\*are considered _low risk_ for major cardiac events (<1%).

Patients with _low risk_ for major cardiac events can be cleared for surgery **without further cardiac testing or risk stratification**.

Patients with **2 or more RCRI** are considered _elevated risk_ for major adverse cardiac event.

Patients with an elevated risk of major adverse cardiac event need not require further cardiac testing if they have \*\*>4 metabolic equivalents (METs) which is considered moderate to excellent. \*\*

Functional status has been found to be an accurate predictor of perioperative and long-term cardiac events. **Metabolic equivalents** are measures of functional status estimated from activities of daily living and can be used to further risk stratify patients with _elevated risk_ for major adverse cardiac events.

A question stem can provide information on a patient's functional status or METs implicitly. A patient who can perform the following or more should be understood to have adequate functional status and not require further testing:

- **Climbing a flight of stairs**
- **Walking up a hill**
- **Performing heavy household work**
- **Rigorous sports activities**

A patient with known or suspected heart disease should _only_ receive a cardiac stress test or echocardiography before surgery \*\*if it is indicated in the absence of proposed surgery. \*\*Patients with the following conditions warrant further study:

- **Unstable angina**
- \*\*Significant arrhythmia \*\*
- **Uncompensated CHF**
- **Severe valvular disease**

Elective surgery should be delayed at least **8 weeks** post-myocardial infarction.

It is recommended that an ECG be obtained in patients undergoing \*\*intermediate-risk procedures or in patients with at least 1 clinical risk factor identified by RCRI, \*\*in order to compare it to a postoperative ECG in the event the postoperative ECG is abnormal.

ECG is unnecessary in all patients undergoing **low risk surgery** (eg. cataract surgery).

# MI

In pts with recent MI, postpone surgery if elective.

# Hepatic

Child-Pugh score is used to predict mortality and short term survival in patients with liver disease. While the classification of patients based on the Child-Pugh score is beyond the scope of Step 2, the following measures of hepatic function are used in scoring:

- **A**lbumin
- **B**ilirubin
- **E**ncephalopathy
- **A**scites
- **P**T (INR)

Mnemonic:**"A BEAP"**

Acute hepatitis is a **contraindication** for elective surgery.

Patients with liver disease should have their medical therapy optimized prior to undergoing surgery. The following should be evaluated in a patient with liver disease prior to surgery:

- \*\*Renal function \*\*
- **Electrolyte abnormalities**
- **Bleeding time / PT (INR) / PTT**
- **Encephalopathy**
- **Nutritional status**

If coagulopathy is present, attempt to normalize INR prior to surgery with:

- **Vitamin K**
- **Fresh frozen plasma  (FFP)**

Prolonged bleeding time can be corrected in a patient with liver disease with **desmopressin (DDAVP)**.

Patients who are taking warfarin should discontinue medication **3 to 4 days before the surgery**. This timing is based on warfarin's half-life, which is approximately 36-42 hours.

For surgeries with a high risk of bleeding the international normalized ratio (INR) should be kept **below 1.5**.

A history of thromboembolism indicates anticoagulation with **heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (e.g. enoxaparin, dalteparin)** after discontinuing warfarin until surgery then restarting warfarin postoperatively.

Heparin or LMWH is resumed **12 hours after surgery.**

# Diabetes

Patients with diabetes mellitus have the following surgical complications:

- **Increased risk of infection**
- **Delayed wound healing**
- **Increase risk of cardiac complications**
- **Increased mortality postoperatively**

Diabetic patients may require **greater than normal insulin administration** postoperatively due to glycemic fluctuations.

# Nephropathy

**Preoperative dialysis** may be necessary for patients with renal insufficiency to control creatinine and electrolytes.

**Acetylcysteine** may be used to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with renal insufficiency, who are expected to receive intraoperative contrast. In addition, volume depletion and NSAIDs should be avoided. **Isotonic IV fluid administration hours before** can prevent volume depletion.

# Nutritional Status

If the patient shows severe nutritional depletion, elective surgery **should be postponed** until optimized.

Severe malnutrition increases operative risk. Indicators of severe nutritional depletion include:

- **Anergy to skin antigens**
- **Serum albumin < 3 g/dL**
- **Serum transferrin < 200 mg/dL**
- **Significant weight loss (e.g., loss of â‰¥ 20% total body weight) over a span of only a few months**

The best lab test to determine acute nutritional status is **prealbumin**, due to its short half life (2-3 days). The normal range is 16-40 mg/dL. Values **<16 mg/dL** are associated with malnutrition.

However, prealbumin is expensive and may be decreased in patients with the following conditions:

- **Physiological stress**
- **Infection**
- **Liver dysfunction**
- **Over-hydration**

# Pulmonary

**Preoperative pulmonary function tests** serve as the best predictors of postoperative pulmonary complications.

Patients with known lung disease (eg. COPD, asthma) and smokers should be considered for preoperative pulmonary function tests (PFTs) \*\*if after clinical evaluation it is still unclear whether the patient is at their best baseline and that airflow obstruction is optimally reduced. \*\*Routine PFTs in patients with stable symptoms and optimized management of their lung disease is NOT recommended.

The most effective way to reduce postoperative respiratory complications is **smoking cessation at least 8 weeks prior to surgery**.

A preoperative FEV1 of **> 1.5 liters** is required for lobectomy.

A preoperative FEV1 of **> 2 liters** is required for pneumonectomy.
