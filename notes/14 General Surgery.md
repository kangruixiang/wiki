<!-- grafts work how.. -->

A surgical graft is the **transfer of tissue without its blood supply to a new location, requiring a new blood supply to form.**

Initially, the graft survives by plasmatic imbibition, or the absorption of transudate. **Capillaries begin to form 48 hours following grafting, with full vascular flow developing 7 days postoperatively**.

<!-- when to use surgical grafts.. -->

Surgical grafts are indicated when the patient experiences:

- **Trauma**
- **Tumor removal**
- **Burns**
- **Poor approximation of wound edges**
- **Chronic ulcers**

<!-- types of skin grafts.. -->

Split thickness skin grafts (STSG) include the **epidermis and some of the dermis, and is usually 10/1000 to 18/1000 of an inch thick**.

Full thickness skin grafts (FTSG) includes the **epidermis and dermis. The donor location requires a surgical flap to repair the extraction site.**

**Full thickness** skin grafts are used in locations **where cosmetic appearance is important** (e.g. the face) or in **areas with increased mobility** (e.g. around joints).

Split thickness \*\*skin grafts contract more than full thickness skin grafts, making them undesirable except \*\*when large grafts are required (e.g. large burns). They are used in cases of large grafts because of the simple healing process of the donor site.

<!-- surgical graft failure causes, treatment.. -->

Failure of a surgical graft may occur secondarily to:

- **Graft movement**
- **Infection**
- **Poor neovascularization**
- **Diabetes mellitus**
- **Malnutrition**
- **Smoking**
- **Corticosteroid therapy**

Graft failure may be treated depending on the extent of failure:

- **Partial loss is managed with moist dressing**
- **Complete loss requires surgical assessment**

## Flap

<!-- surgical flap is.. -->

A surgical flap is defined as **the transfer of tissue with its original blood supply to a new location.**

<!-- when to use surgical flap.. -->

Surgical flaps are indicated when:

- **The wound area is poorly vascularized**
- **The wound cannot be closed without high tension**
- **A large wound occurs in a cosmetically delicate location** (e.g. breast reconstruction)

<!-- types of surgical flap.. -->

Surgical flaps may be categorized by location of original tissue such as:

- **Simple flaps: skin that is adjacent to the wound**
- **Regional flaps: skin is found nearby, but not immediately adjacent to the wound**
- **Distant flaps: tissue taken from a distant region of the body**

Surgical flaps may be categorized by route of vascularization:

- **Free flaps have a blood supply that was reconnected microvascularly**
- **Prefabricated flaps have a blood supply connected from a distal site**

<!-- surgical flap failure cause, treatment.. -->

Surgical flap failure is most commonly secondary to **poor vascularization of the flap.**

Surgical flaps that have become necrosed require **surgical debridement.**
