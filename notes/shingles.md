<!-- shingles in hospital what kind of precaution -->

Patients with herpes zoster may transmit **varicella-zoster virus** (VZV) through **direct contact** (primarily) or aerosolized particles (rarely) to health care personnel (HCP) and other individuals.  As such, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the following precautions for hospitalized patients with herpes zoster **until lesions are crusted over** (indicating they are no longer infectious):

- Localized infection - standard precautions and lesion covering
- Disseminated infection - standard precautions plus **contact and airborne precautions**

All HCP should also have pre-employment screening to ensure immunity to VZV; those who have not had previous varicella infection should be immunized with a 2-dose varicella vaccine.  Only HCP with known immunity to VZV should be allowed to interact with patients with active VZV infection; however, because vaccination is not 100% effective, the precautions outlined above are still required

<!-- shingles acute flare treatment -->

- oral valacyclovir  for 7 days
- only immunocompromised patients (HIV) needs IV
- oral acyclovir is 5x/day dosing. Valacyclovir is TID and preferred

Post herpetic neuralgia

<!-- Shingles complications -->

This patient's history and presentation are consistent with herpes zoster (shingles), a condition caused by reactivation of latent  varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The most common complication of shingles  is development of postherpetic neuralgia, which is defined as persistent pain in the distribution of the vesicular eruption that lasts 3 to 4  months or more following resolution of the rash. Older patients and  patients who experience severe pain during the prodrome or active phase  of the eruption are at increased risk of developing postherpetic  neuralgia. Treatment of herpes zoster should be initiated within 72  hours of rash onset, as this has been shown to decrease the risk of  developing postherpetic neuralgia and promotes more rapid healing of the vesicular eruption.

Treatment of herpes zoster has not been shown to prevent recurrent  episodes. Immunosuppression, however, does increase the risk of  recurrent herpes zoster. A VZV vaccine is available that is effective  in preventing herpes zoster in patients over 60 years of age.

<!-- shingles exposure management -->

All health care personnel (HCP) should receive pre-employment screening to ensure immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV).  HCP are considered immune if they have a documented **previous history of varicella** (as in this nurse) or have received the **2-dose varicella vaccine**.  Immune HCP **do not require postexposure prophylaxis** after working with patients with herpes zoster.

HCP who do not have immunity to VZV typically receive postexposure prophylaxis with the varicella vaccine within 5 days of exposure.  This reduces risk of transmission by approximately 80%.  For HCP who do not have immunity to VZV and are also immunocompromised or pregnant, varicella-zoster immune globulin or antiviral therapy (if immunoglobulin is unavailable) is typically required.

<!-- shingles spread prevention at home -->

- lesions can be transmitted until they are completely crusted over and dry
- direct contact and rarely aerosolization can spread the disease
- antiviral can expedite process of healing

As such, patients treated in the outpatient setting for active herpes zoster lesions should be advised to **cover the rash** to prevent direct contact and to avoid patients who are highly susceptible to illness, such as pregnant women who have never had varicella or the varicella vaccine, low-birth-weight infants, and immunocompromised individuals.  Patients may otherwise go about their normal activities without restriction.
