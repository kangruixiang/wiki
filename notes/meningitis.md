## Treatment

This patient presents with acute ==hospital-acquired (healthcare-associated) bacterial meningitis== after recent brain surgery.  The lumbar puncture findings of neutrophilic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and low CSF glucose strongly suggest a bacterial etiology.  Following brain surgery, the most likely organisms to cause meningitis include ==gram-negative bacilli== (e.g., _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_) and ==gram-positive cocci== (e.g., methicillin resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_).  Both ==cefepime and ceftazidime== have good CNS penetration as well as broad coverage against gram-negative organisms, especially _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and some coverage against gram-positive organisms (e.g., _Streptococcus pneumoniae_).  ==Vancomycin== is effective against MRSA.

Ceftriaxone and vancomycin are appropriate for empiric treatment of community-acquired meningitis in patients aged 2-50 years, as this combination retains good coverage against _S. pneumoniae_.  However, ceftriaxone does not adequately cover _Pseudomonas_.  Acyclovir is not needed as HSV meningitis is unlikely.

Piperacillin/tazobactam has good coverage against _Pseudomonas_ and other gram-negative organisms, but does not have good CNS penetration.

Ampicillin is usually added in suspected bacterial meningitis to cover for _Listeria monocytogenes_ in patients > age 50 or the immunocompromised.
