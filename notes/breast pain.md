**Mastalgia** (breast pain) is a common and benign symptom that most women experience due to estrogen and progesterone changes associated with the **menstrual cycle**.  The pain is often **cyclic**, beginning up to 2 weeks before menses and usually subsiding by the onset of menses; it is typically described as heavy, diffuse, dull, and **bilateral**.  Generalized swelling and **mildly tender nodularity** may be present, but there are no discrete masses or nipple discharge.

Symptomatic relief can be achieved by wearing a **properly fitted bra** with good breast support that minimizes breast movement.  Acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen) can also be administered for pain relief.  In addition, danazol is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for mastalgia; however, it may cause permanent androgenic side effects (eg, hirsutism) and increases the risk of thromboembolism.
