**Neurofibromatosis type I** (NFI) is an **autosomal dominant** disorder due to a mutation in the _NF1_ tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 17q11.2. **Caf√©-au-lait macules** (CALMs) are a hallmark feature. Although a few CALMs are common in the general population, patients with NFI have numerous, widespread CALMs  that typically increase in number during childhood. In addition, **freckling** in the inguinal and axillary skin folds, as seen in this patient, is highly concerning for NFI. Other common features include neurofibromas, which are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors in the skin, and Lisch  nodules, which are iris hamartomas that do not affect vision.

Once the diagnosis of NFI is suspected, **ophthalmologic evaluation** for **optic pathway gliomas** is indicated. **Bilateral** optic pathway gliomas are virtually pathognomonic for NFI but may be  asymptomatic initially. Early detection is critical due to risk of  progressive **vision loss**. Visual acuity, confrontation  visual field testing, color vision testing, and extraocular motility  must be assessed. If the eye examination is abnormal, MRI of the brain  and orbits may be performed to determine tumor size and extent of  intracranial extension.

Patients with neurofibromatosis type II (NFII) require audiologic  evaluation for sensorineural hearing loss due to bilateral vestibular  schwannomas, which are not as common in NFI. CALMs are not a classic  feature of NFII.

Serum growth hormone is often elevated in patients with McCune-Albright  syndrome, which classically presents with CALMs with irregular borders  as well as fibrous dysplasia and precocious puberty. This patient has  CALMs with smooth borders, consistent with NFI.
