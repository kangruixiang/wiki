# Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia

Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is an **_irregularly-irregular_ supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)** characterized by the presence of **3 or more ectopic atrial pacemaking foci**.

MAT occurs more commonly in patients with **COPD**, **hypoxemia**, and **underlying pulmonary dysfunction**. Other Less common etiological factors include hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, sepsis, and theophylline or digitalis toxicity.

Most patients found to have MAT present with **symptoms of an underlying pulmonary condition** (e.g. shortness of breath, productive cough, chest pain). _Only rarely do patients present with primary complaints of palpitations or syncopal episodes._

The best diagnostic test is an **electrocardiogram (ECG)**, which will show an **_(irregularly) irregular_ rhythm** with an \*\*atrial rate greater than 100 bpm \*\*and **at least 3 _morphologically distinct_ P waves on the _same lead_**.

An ECG of MAT has the following defining features:

- **An atrial rate of 100-200 BPM**
- **At least three morphologically distinct P waves occurring on the same lead**
- **P waves return to baseline**
- **P-P intervals, P-R duration, and R-R intervals vary**
- **Some P waves may not be conducted, but _every QRS complex is preceded by a P wave_**

MAT can be suspected in patients with an **irregular, rapid pulse and a history of pulmonary disease**.

- Treatment
	- Underlying condition: COPD, remove offending medications, correct electrolytes (especially K and Mg)
	- Symtomatic tachycardia: rate control with verapamil or cardioselective BB (metoprolol, esmolol)
	- For patients with ongoing, symptomatic MAT who cannot tolerate pharmacologic rate control, **radiocatheter ablation of the AV node and concomitant pacemaker placement** provide a final means of relief.
