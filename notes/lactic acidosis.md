## Type B

D-Lactic acidosis presents with an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis and characteristic neurologic findings of intermittent confusion, slurred speech, and ataxia in patients with short-bowel syndrome. Accumulation of the D-isomer of lactate can occur in patients with short-bowel syndrome following jejunoileal bypass or small-bowel resection. In these patients, excess carbohydrates that reach the colon are metabolized to D-lactate. Laboratory studies show increased anion gap metabolic acidosis with normal plasma lactate levels, because the D-isomer is not measured by conventional laboratory assays for lactate. Diagnosis is confirmed by specifically measuring D-lactate. This patient's lack of short-bowel syndrome rules out this diagnosis.

## Type B

- Decreased clearance: malignancy, liver dysfunction, drugs (linezolid, HAART, maybe metformin)
- Short bowel syndrome: D lactic acid

- In hospital we check L lactic acid
- Mammals make L
- D lactate: bacteria fermentation in bowels make D lactate
