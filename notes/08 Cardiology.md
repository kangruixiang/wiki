# CABG

<!-- CABG indications, vs PCI usage.. -->

A coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) utilizes arteries or veins from elsewhere in the patient's body to bypass atherosclerotic stenosis and improve coronary blood flow. The 2 primary indications for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) are patients with:

- **Left main coronary stenosis of 50%**
- **3-vessel disease**

Percutaneous coronary intervention is indicated in patients with **single or two vessel disease and normal LV function**.

<!-- CABG uses which artery/vein.. -->

Grafts used in coronary artery bypass surgery include the internal thoracic artery and saphenous vein, among others. **Internal thoracic arteries** are more commonly used as they have been shown to have the **best long term patency**.

<!-- CABG complications.. -->

The four most common noncardiac complications of CABG are:

- **Bleeding**
- **Stroke, or other neurologic problems**
- **Infection: mediastinitis**
- **Acute kidney injury**

## Mediastinitis

<!-- mediastinitis cause, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

This patient presents with findings consistent with likely acute mediastinitis, a possible complication of cardiac surgery that is usually due to **intraoperative wound contamination**.  Mediastinitis can complicate up to 5% of sternotomies.  Patients typically present post-operatively (usually within 14 days) with fever, tachycardia, chest pain, leukocytosis, and **sternal wound drainage** or purulent discharge (as in this patient).  Hamman’s sign is a **crunching sound** heard with a stethoscope over the precordium during systole and is suggestive of acute mediastinitis.

Chest x-ray usually shows a **widened mediastinum** in non-postoperative mediastinitis, but this can also be seen in postoperative mediastinitis after cardiac surgery.  Chest radiograph findings include **pneumomediastinum** and/or **air-fluid levels** within the mediastinum. A CT scan can also support the diagnosis by demonstrating **dehiscence** of the sternum and **stranding**, fluid and a**ir pockets** within the anterior mediastinum. The diagnosis is usually clinically made and confirmed during surgery when pus is noted in the mediastinum. Postoperative mediastinitis require**s drainage, surgical debridement with immediate closure, and prolonged antibiotic therapy**.  Antibiotics alone do not appropriately treat mediastinitis.  Acute mediastinitis has a mortality rate of 10%–50%, even with appropriate treatment.

## AFIB

<!-- CABG and afib.. -->

Atrial fibrillation commonly (up to 15%–40%) occurs within a few days after CABG and is usually self-limited, with resolution in less than 24 hours.  Rate control with beta-blockers or amiodarone is best. Anticoagulation and/or cardioversion is reserved for patients with atrial fibrillation lasting >24 hours after CABG.  Since this patient requires immediate surgery anticoagulation should not be given.

# Catherterization

## Hematoma

<!-- catheterization hematoma cause, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment.. -->

This patient's presentation (recent cardiac catheterization, anticoagulation with heparin, sudden onset of hypotension, tachycardia, flat neck veins, and back pain) is consistent with **retroperitoneal hematoma** due to bleeding from the arterial access site (with retroperitoneal extension).  Local vascular complications at the catheter insertion site - bleeding, hematoma (localized or with retroperitoneal extension), arterial dissection, acute thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm, or arteriovenous fistula formation - are the most common complications of cardiac catheterization.  Most hemorrhage or hematoma formation occurs **within 12 hours** of catheterization.

Patients with hematoma present with localized discomfort and/or swelling of the soft tissue.  **If the arterial puncture site is above the inguinal ligament, the hematoma can extend into the retroperitoneal space**, even with minimal visible localized hematoma, and present with sudden **hemodynamic instability** and ipsilateral **flank or back pain**.  Diagnosis is confirmed with **non-contrast CT scan** of abdomen and pelvis or abdominal ultrasound.  Treatment is usually supportive, with intensive monitoring, bed rest, and intravenous fluids or blood transfusion.  Surgical repair of hematomas or retroperitoneal hemorrhage is rarely required.

# Prosthetic Valves

<!-- 2 types of prosthetic valves, indications.. -->

The two categories of valve replacement are **tissue** and **mechanical**.

Tissue valves are indicated in patients:

- **Older than 65**
- **Who do not want anticoagulation**
- **Women of childbearing age**

Mechanical valves are indicated in patients:

- **Younger than 65**
- That have **no contraindications to anticoagulants**
- \*\*Who are \*\*reliable to take anticoagulants

**The St. Jude mechanical valve** is the most commonly used valve in aortic and mitral valve replacement due to its **double-disk tilting, hemodynamics, and low thrombogenicity**.

<!-- prosthetic valve risks.. -->

The major risk associated with mechanical valves is the **need for lifelong anticoagulation**.

The major risk associated with a tissue valve is **structural deterioration of the valve** requiring 30% of patients in need of replacement in 10 years and 50% in 15 years.

Valve obstruction can result from thrombosis due to:

- **Poor anticoagulation**
- **Formation of a fibrous tissue ingrowth called a pannus (less common)**
- **Vegetations due to poor antibiotic prophylaxis**

Non-structural dysfunction is a general term for valve complications that arise and include:

- **Inappropriate sizing**
- **Hemolysis**
- **Tissue or suture entrapment**
- **Paravalvular leak**

<!-- prosthetic valve endocarditis early and late pathogenesis, organisms.. -->

Operated prosthetic valvular endocarditis can be early (<60 days following implantation) or late. Early prosthetic valve endocarditis is when the valve is **seeded intraoperatively** or **via catheters, cannulas, or wound infections**.

Organisms involved in early prosthetic valve endocarditis include

- **_Staphylococcus aureus_**
- **_Staphylococcus epidermidis_**
- **Gram-negative bacteria**
	- **HACEK** organisms
		- _Haemophilus_
		- _Aggregatibacter_ (formerly _Actinobacillus_)
		- _Cardiobacterium_
		- _Eikenella_
		- _Kingella_
	- **_Pseudomonas_**

Late prosthetic valve endocarditis is typically due to noncardiac **sepsis arising from dental, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tracts**.

Organisms involved in late prosthetic valve endocarditis include _Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp_. with **viridans streptococci** being the most common.

# Aortic Stenosis

<!-- ignore.. -->

Aortic stenosis is **narrowing of the aortic valve** due to calcification of the valve leaflets or valvular damage.

## Causes

<!-- aortic stenosis causes.. -->

The most common cause of aortic stenosis is **calcification of _otherwise normal_ valve leaflets with age**; the prevalence increases rapidly in the 7th decade of life.

Aortic stenosis commonly occurs at an early age in patients with **congenital bicuspid aortic valves**.

Aortic stenosis can also result from **rheumatic fever**. _Though rheumatic fever is most strongly associated with mitral stenosis, other valves may also be affected._

## Symptoms

<!-- ignore.. -->

Advanced aortic stenosis is classically associated with **syncope**, **angina**, and **heart failure**. Disease may be asymptomatic up to this point.

The **left ventricle grows progressively hypertrophied** as the myocardium contracts against the **mounting afterload**. The \*\*myocardium outgrows its blood supply, leading to ischemia \*\*that results in progressive chest pain, dyspnea, and pulmonary congestion.

Aortic stenosis causes a **systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur heard loudest in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border**, which often radiates to the **carotid arteries** or can be **auscultated at the clavicles**.

The murmur **_increases_ in intensity with maneuvers that _increase preload_ (e.g. leg-raising)** and _**decreases**_ **in intensity with maneuvers that _decrease_ preload (e.g. Valsalva) or _increase_ _afterload_ (e.g. isometric hand-squeezing)**.

Aortic stenosis is associated with an **S4 heart sound.**

Physical exam may reveal \*\*pulsus parvus et tardus \*\*(weak peripheral pulses with a maximal intensity peak that is late relative to the heartbeat) due to the slowed emptying of left ventricle to the systemic circulation.

## Diagnosis

<!-- ignore.. -->

Echocardiography confirms the physical findings by demonstrating a **narrowed valve area with increased transvalvular pressure gradient and possible left atrial enlargement**.

Cardiac catheterization is indicated **to delineate the severity of disease when a noninvasive test proves non-diagnostic**, or **when there is a discrepancy between physical and echocardiographic findings**.

Chest X-ray is usually normal but in cases of more severe and progressed disease may demonstrate a **rounding of the left ventricular apex** consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy. _Note that valvular calcifications are not necessarily visible on chest radiograph, but may still be present._

Electrocardogram (ECG) will often show **left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)**, **left atrial enlargement**, and **left bundle branch block (LBBB)**. Severe dilation of the left atrium can result in atrial fibrillation in late disease. _Note that these findings are nonspecific._

Once symptomatic, the **progression of aortic stenosis can be rapid**, and patients are at increasing risk for **sudden cardiac death**.

The presentation of aortic stenosis has prognostic value. In order of _worsening_ prognosis, this includes:

- **Angina**
- **Syncope**
- **Heart failure**

<!-- aortic stenosis bleeding and anemia.. -->

Severely calcified aortic valves can **shred von Willebrand factor multimers**, leading to a bleeding diathesis that classically presents with **gastrointestinal bleeding from angiodysplasia**. (This is sometimes referred to as Heyde's syndrome.)

Though it more commonly occurs with prosthetic valves, mechanical shearing of red blood cells across the damaged calcific valve may lead to an **intravascular hemolytic anemia**. Supportive findings include **schistocytes** on peripheral smear, **elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**, **low haptoglobin**, **hemoglobinuria**, and a \*\*normal platelet count \*\*in a patient with diagnosed aortic stenosis.

## Management

<!-- aortic stenosis management.. -->

Asymptomatic aortic stenosis is managed medically **until surgical valve replacement is indicated** and **in patients who are not good surgical candidates**.

Medical management is used in asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients who are not surgical candidates. It consists of:

- **Medication to control hypertension** (usually diuretic and ACE inhibitor/ARB)
- **Avoidance of vigorous physical exercise**
- **Avoidance of venodilators** (e.g. nitrates, phosphodiesterase inhibitors) and **negative inotropes** (e.g. calcium channel blockers/beta blockers) as these lessen preload

Note: Medications which affect loading conditions should be used with caution since patients with severely symptomatic aortic stenosis have a small therapeutic window.

**Aortic valve replacement** is the _only definitive treatment_ for aortic stenosis. Indications for valve replacement according to the ACC/AHA guidelines include:

- **_Symptomatic_** stenosis, as indicated by the presence of \*\*angina, syncope, \*\*or **heart failure (CHF)**;
- \*\*_Severe_ stenosis in \*\*_**asymptomatic patients**_ who are undergoing **CABG**, surgery or replacement of an additional valve, or of the aorta;
- **_Severe_ stenosis in _asymptomatic patients_** with **systolic failure** (_ejection fraction less than 50%)._

_Severe stenosis_ is defined as a valve cross-sectional area less than 1.0 cm2, mean gradient greater than 40 mm Hg, or jet velocity greater than 4.0 m/s.

**Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)** is used for stabilization and bridge to surgery.

# AVM

<!-- ignore.. -->

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are **congenital or acquired aberrant connections between arterial and venous circulations**, which **bypass the normal physiological pressure drop-off created by capillary beds**.

AVMs involving the larger more proximal vasculature may result in a significant **reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR)**.

<!-- chronic AVM causes.. -->

**Penetrating traumatic injuries** with associated **vascular damage** may result in chronic AVMs.

<!-- AVM symptoms, management.. -->

**Superficial AVMs** can present as **palpable, warm, pulsatile masses**. **Deeper AVMs** may be asymptomatic or may produce symptoms secondary to **mass effect** and **local ischemia** as well as **reduced SVR**.

A persistently reduced SVR can eventually progress to **high-output cardiac failure**. Seizure and hemorrhagic stroke are two consequences for AVM in brain.

Large, symptomatic AVMs as well as AVMs located in the brain and bowel should be **surgically removed** or **sclerosed**.

# Hypertensive Crisis

<!-- hypertensive urgency definition, symptoms.. -->

Hypertensive urgency is defined as a **systolic blood pressure (SBP) >180 mm Hg _or_ a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >120 mm Hg _without physical evidence of target organ damage_**.

Patients with hypertensive urgency present with **non-progressive symptoms** including **headache**, **shortness of breath**, **epistaxis**, or **pedal edema**.

<!-- hypertensive emergency is, symptoms.. -->

Hypertensive emergency in non-pregnant patients is defined as the **presence of end-organ damage** (cardiac, renal, central nervous system, etc.) which is **due to severely elevated blood pressure**. Generally this occurs when DBP > 120 mm Hg, but may occur at lower pressures if there has been a rapid increase above baseline.

Though patients suffering from hypertensive emergencies may be asymptomatic, by definition end-organ damage is present. This may include:

- **Acute myocardial infarction**
- **Hypertensive encephalopathy/retinopathy**
- **Intracranial hemorrhage**
- **Dissecting aneurysm**
- **Acute renal failure**
- **Flash pulmonary edema**

**SBP > 159 mm Hg _or_ DBP > 109 mm Hg** that persists for at least **15 minutes** in a **pregnant female** is considered a hypertensive emergency, _regardless of the presence or absence of additional symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings_, and should be managed accordingly.

<!-- hypertensive crisi triggers.. -->

Most hypertensive crises are due to an acute exacerbation of underlying hypertension, frequently brought on by noncompliance with antihypertensive therapy. Additional causes include:

- **Medication side effect:** oral contraceptives, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), linezolid, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
- \*\*Recreational drug use: \*\*cocaine, amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust)
- \*\*Pregnancy: \*\*pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, HELLP syndrome
- **Any cause of secondary hypertension** (recall the \*\*_DRAPE_ \*\*mnemonic)

<!-- malignant hypertension is, result.. -->

Malignant hypertension is a **subset of a hypertensive emergency** marked by an **accelerated course of rapidly rising BP** and the presence of \*\*papilledema \*\*on physical exam.

Renal pathological changes associated with malignant hypertension include a **flea bitten kidney** (multiple hemorrhages due to ruptured arterioles in a large swollen kidney).

## Management

<!-- ignore.. -->

Initial evaluation of a hypertensive crisis should include:

- **Serum electrolytes** to rule out hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia
- **Serum BUN and creatinine** to assess renal function
- **Liver function tests** (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, PT/INR)
- **Complete blood count with peripheral smear**
- **Urinalysis with microscopy**
- **Electrocardiogram**
- **Chest x-ray** if the patient complains of chest pain
- **Non-contrast CT** in patients with neurological symptoms or complaining of a headache

<!-- hypertensive emergency treatment.. -->

Urgency treatment: oral captopril, furosemide, or clonidine.

The treatment of hypertensive emergency requires three steps:

- **Immediate admission to an intensive care unit (ICU)**
- **Parenteral (IV) administration of a titratable anti-hypertensive agent**
- **Continuous monitoring of blood pressure, neurological status, and urine output**

For most hypertensive emergencies, **mean arterial pressure should be reduced by no more than 25% within the first 24 hours**. This is usually accomplished by a reduction of 10% during the first hour and an additional 15% over the next 23 hours.

The most appropriate IV agent(s) to treat a hypertensive emergency are **dictated by the presentation**:

- **Hypertensive encephalopathy: labetalol**
- **Pregnancy: hydralazine**
- **Aortic dissection: 2 IV agents**(e.g. **labetalol + esmolol**)

(Please refer to the chart for a more complete approach including more conditions and treatment options.)

Prolonged infusion with nitroprusside can lead to **cyanide toxicity** (nitroprusside contains 5 cyanide groups per molecule), particularly in pediatric patients and patients with chronic renal failure. Patients present with altered mental status and lactic acidosis.

# Left CHF

## Causes

<!-- 2 types CHF based on EF, causes.. -->

Left congestive heart failure (CHF) is evaluated and treated on the basis of whether the **ejection fraction** (EF) **is preserved or reduced**:

- CHF with reduced EF occurs when insufficient cardiac output is due to **reduced ventricular contraction**. This is sometimes referred to as **systolic dysfunction**, and is the more common pathophysiological type.
- CHF with preserved EF occurs when insufficient cardiac output is due to **reduced ventricular compliance**. This is sometimes referred to as **diastolic dysfunction**.

Systolic dysfunction occurs when **chronic _volume_ overload** leads to **_eccentric_ hypertrophy** (i.e. sarcomeres added in _series_), and is most often a sequela of **cardiac ischemia** and **coronary artery disease (CAD)**. _You can think of this as the heart's attempt to accommodate a chronically escalating preload through eccentric remodeling._

Diastolic dysfunction occurs when **chronic _pressure_ overload** leads to **_concentric_ hypertrophy** (i.e. sarcomeres added in _parallel_), and is most often a sequela of **poorly managed hypertension**. _You can think of this as the heart's attempt to accommodate a chronically escalating afterload through concentric remodeling._

## Symptoms

<!-- CHF symptoms, pathogenesis.. -->

Left-sided heart failure generally presents with **symptoms of pulmonary congestion and fluid overload**:

- **Dyspnea on exertion**
- **Orthopnea**
- **Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea**
- **Nocturia**

_Note that the clinical presentation of systolic and diastolic heart failure are indistinguishable from each other, as they both result from a decrease in forward blood flow._

Dyspnea on exertion is caused by **interstitial fluid in the lung stimulating juxtacapillary receptors (J receptors)**, innervated by the vagus nerve, causing rapid shallow breathing.

Orthopnea refers to **shortness of breath that occurs when laying flat** that results from an **increase in venous return**. _The severity of orthopnea is assessed by asking the patient **the number of pillows on which they sleep** to avoid breathlessness._

Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) refers to severe **breathlessness that awakens a patient from sleep. Gradual reabsorption of fluid from the interstitium of the lower extremities into the vascular compartment leads to increased venous return**, which worsens pulmonary congestion. _While orthopnea is a direct manifestation of cardiac insufficiency, **PND results from the fluid-avid state that serves as a compensatory mechanism to try to accommodate diminishing forward cardiac output by increasing preload**._

Fluid overload occurs as the decreased cardiac output causes an **activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system** with retention of salt and water.

Hemoptysis may occur in left heart failure due to the **rupture of engorged bronchial veins.**

Brick-red sputum results from an increased pressure in the alveolar capillaries that causes red cells to leak out. \*\*Alveolar macrophages ingest red blood cells. \*\*These **hemosiderin-laden macrophages** are called _heart failure cells_.

## Diagnosis

<!-- CHF diagnosis.. -->

Diagnosis of CHF is based primarily on clinical history and physical exam, which should include **initial and serial measurements of weight** as a proxy for determining volume status.

An **S3 "Kentucky" gallop** is classically associated with _systolic_ dysfunction.

An \*\*S4 "Tennessee" gallop \*\*is classically associated with _diastolic_ dysfunction.

**Cardiogenic pulmonary edema** may be detected as rales over both lung fields most prominent at the bases, and may be accompanied by expiratory wheezing.

Echocardiography or catheterization in systolic heart failure demonstrates **reduced EF**, **increased end-diastolic volume (EDV)**, **and elevated end-diastolic pressure (EDP, filling pressure)**.

Echocardiography or catheterization in diastolic heart failure demonstrates **low-to-normal EF**,\*\* decreased EDV, elevated filling pressure.\*\*

\*\*Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)\*\*is commonly used to clarify acute CHF exacerbations, but serial measurements are not generally recommended to monitor treatment response.

Chest x-ray findings include:

- **Kerley B lines** (thin pulmonary opacities caused by fluid in the interstitium of the lung)
- **Enlarged cardiac silhouette**
- **Peribronchial cuffing** (excess fluid in the small airway passages of the lung causes localized patches of atelectasis)
- **Cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature** (antigravitational redistribution of the pulmonary blood flow due in part to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary hypertension)

## Management

<!-- acute CHF management. Long term management.. -->

Acutely decompensated CHF exacerbations are most appropriately treated with **LMNOP**:

- **Lasix** (furosemide) or another loop diuretic to reduce volume overload
- **Morphine** to reduce anxiety and relieve chest pain
- **Nitroglycerin**
- **Oxygen** (supplemental)
- \*\*Positioning \*\*(seated upright)

Initial treatment for heart failure begins with asymptomatic, high-risk patients who have yet to develop structural heart disease (ACCF/AHA Class A). This consists of **controlling hypertension, lipid disorders, and diabetes mellitus (DM)**, in addition to **lifestyle modifications** targeted at **reducing obesity**, **smoking cessation**, and **limiting alcohol consumption**.

Long term treatment is based on symptomatic measures as well as primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. For testing purposes, _only the following pharmacologic interventions have been shown to improve survival in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction_ (i.e. systolic failure):

- **Beta-blockers** (**carvedilol**, **metoprolol succinate**, and **bisoprolol** _ONLY_)
- **Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)** or **angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)**
- **A ldosterone antagonists (spironolactone)** for patients NYHA Class III & IV
- **Hydralazine + isosorbide dinitrate**, _in addition to standard therapy with the above drugs_ for African-Americans

The combination of **hydralazine + isosorbide dinitrate** is recommended as a replacement for ACEIs or ARBs in patients who are unable to tolerate any drugs in either class.

Diuretics are used for symptomatic control and **fluid overload management**. Lasix (furosemide) is most often used for its potency. **Metolazone** may be added to furosemide to increase potency and diuresis. Loop diuretics have the added benefit of **opposing the hyperkalemia** caused by beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and aldosterone antagonists.

Inotropes such as digoxin **provide symptomatic relief and decrease hospitalizations**, but have no overall effect on mortality.

Calcium channel blockers have equivocal effects on survival and are**currently not recommended for treatment of CHF**.

# CVC

<!-- central venous catheter needed when, placed where, complications, comfirmation how.. -->

A **central venous catheter (CVC)** is commonly used for the administration of critical care medications (eg, pressors, hypertonic saline) and in the setting of difficult vascular access or need for long-term medication (eg, chemotherapy).  The preferred points of central venous access are the internal jugular vein (typically by ultrasound guidance) or the subclavian vein (typically by anatomic landmark guidance).  CVC **complications** occur in up to 15% of cases, and many are due to **inappropriate catheter placement**.

The ideal placement of a CVC tip is in the lower superior vena cava.  Tip placement in smaller veins (eg, subclavian, jugular, azygous) predisposes to **venous perforation**.  In addition, inappropriately placed catheter tips may cause lung puncture, leading to **pneumothorax**, or myocardial perforation, leading to **pericardial tamponade**.  Arterial (eg, subclavian) puncture is also a risk, particularly in the absence of ultrasound guidance.

Confirmatory chest x-ray may be omitted in the setting of an uncomplicated (eg, first needle insertion, no resistance to catheter advancement) ultrasound-guided CVC placement.  Otherwise, a **portable chest x-ray** should be performed immediately following CVC placement to facilitate timely recognition of a misplaced catheter tip, identify possible injury (eg, pneumothorax), and prevent exacerbation of injury (eg, infusion of fluid into the pericardial space).  Visualization of the catheter tip just proximal to the angle between the trachea and right mainstem bronchus confirms appropriate placement.

# Anterior Mediastinal Mass

<!-- 4 ddx for anterior mediastinal mass.. -->

The differential diagnosis for an anterior mediastinal mass includes the "4 T's":

- thymoma
- teratoma
- thyroid neoplasm
- terrible lymphoma

Within the category of teratoma, one must also include other germ cell tumors.  Teratomas can often be distinguished from other germ cell tumors on imaging by the presence of **fat** or **calcium**, particularly if in the form of a tooth.  Serum hormone levels may be helpful in differentiating seminomatous germ cell tumors from nonseminomatous variants.  Serum **β-HCG** can be elevated in 1/3 of patients with a seminoma, although the AFP is essentially always normal.  Nonseminomatous forms of germ cell tumors include yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma, and embryonal carcinoma.  A mixture of different cell types is also possible and is referred to as a mixed germ cell tumor.  Most patients with a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor have an elevated AFP, with a considerable amount also having an elevated β-HCG.

While seminomas often cause an elevated β-HCG, the AFP is essentially always normal.

# MUGA

<!-- MUGA scan is, used for.. -->

Multi Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA) scan. The MUGA scan is the most **accurate test in measuring ejection fraction**. It is a noninvasive nuclear test that uses a radioactive isotope called technetium to evaluate the function of the ventricles (for example, before trastuzumab). Though not as accurate, an echocardiogram (B) is used more commonly because it is cheaper and more readily available and can look for valve function as well as focal areas of wall motion abnormality. Electrocardiogram (C) and exercise stress test are unable to measure a patient’s ejection fraction. Coronary angiography (D) is considered the gold standard in identifying coronary artery disease and can estimate ejection fraction, but is not as accurate.
