# disseminated intravascular coagulation

- related: [[Hemeonc]], [[DIC vs liver disease]]
- tags: #note

## Common Causes

Common Causes

- sepsis: not that common
- most common: malignancy (APL), B cell malignancies
- pregnancy/delivery, amniotic fluid

## Pathogenesis

- exposure to TF  => thrombosis => clotting
- dysregulation of coagulation system: everything ramped up. More coagulation and fibrinolysis

## Stage 1

- PT/PTT: normal/low
- microthrombi, schisctocytes
- AC: heparin gtt

## Stage 2:

- factors low
- Protein C inhibits cascade and shuts down cascade
- PT/PTT high, fibrinogen low, very high D-Dimer
- bleeding
- give cryoprecipitate first, 10-15u, can help with accurate PT/INR check
- give plasma, 1u
- give FFP

## Stage 3

- Protein C low
- more plugs and thrombi
- only antithrombin left: lysis of old clots, oozing from old wound
- give plt, cryo, FFP
