# renovascular hypertension

Renovascular hypertension is the most common correctable cause of secondary hypertension and should be suspected in patients with clinical clues suggestive of **renovascular disease**.  Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is present in about 1% of patients with mild hypertension, in up to 45% of Caucasian patients with severe hypertension, and in 25%-35% of patients with peripheral arterial disease (as in this patient with reduced peripheral pulses).  Such patients should have noninvasive assessment with **renal duplex Doppler ultrasonography or CT or MR angiography (MRA)** for the diagnosis of RAS.  Renal Doppler ultrasound is the initial preferred modality in patients with renal insufficiency due to risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (with CT angiography) and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (with gadolinium-enhanced MRA).  Noncontrast MRA may be performed when available.
