_Sporothrix schenckii_ is a low-virulence,  dimorphic fungus found in soil and decaying plant matter. Humans  acquire the infection when the organism is inoculated into the skin or  subcutaneous tissue. As such, sporotrichosis typically occurs in those  who engage in **outdoor** vocational or recreational activities such as landscaping or gardening.

The first manifestation is typically a **painless** **papule** at the site of inoculation, which soon ulcerates and drains a **nonpurulent**, **odorless fluid**.  Over days, similar lesions usually develop along the proximal lymphatic chain. History and physical examination are often sufficient for  diagnosis, but cultures from aspirate fluid are typically obtained.  Treatment with 3-6 months of **itraconazole** is usually curative.

<!-- A 28-year-old man comes to the office due to a skin rash on his right cheek. He was exploring caves in central Pennsylvania 2 weeks ago when he sustained a scrape to his cheek from a fallen tree  branch. The abrasion improved over a few days, but a red bump appeared  at the injury site soon after. The bump gradually enlarged and began to drain a clear fluid with no odor.  Two similar bumps then developed near the previous lesion. The patient has had no fever, malaise, cough, or shortness of breath. He does not  use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal  limits. A 1.5-cm (0.6-in), erythematous nodule with central ulceration  is present at the right jaw line. There is a minimal amount of serous  drainage from the lesion. Two smaller erythematous nodules are present  in the right anterior cervical area. The cervical lymph nodes are  enlarged. The remainder of the physical examination is normal. Which  of the following is the most likely diagnosis? -->
