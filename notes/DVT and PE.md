# DVT and PE

<!-- DVT in younger population cause --> 

It is unusual for an otherwise healthy 37-year-old to suddenly develop a DVT, especially in the absence of any recent provoking factors such as  trauma, surgery, or a long plane trip. The sudden death of this  patient's paternal uncle at a young age should raise a red flag that he  may have an inherited hypercoagulable condition. The most common cause  of inherited thrombophilia (accounting for approximately 50% of cases) is Factor V Leiden, the presence of which results in a resistance to the antithrombotic effects of protein C. Confirming a diagnosis of inherited thrombophilia is extremely important because  these patients have an increased risk of developing DVTs, pulmonary  emboli, and blood clots in other locations. As a result, they may need  to be placed on lifelong anticoagulation.

A prothrombin gene mutation (G20210A) is a common  cause of inherited thrombophilia, but it does not necessarily result in a higher level of the protein.

Protein S helps to block coagulation and deficiency of it can lead to  thrombophilia. Inherited protein S deficiency is rare compared to the  frequency of Factor V Leiden. Antithrombin III deficiency is a relatively rare cause of inherited thrombophilia. Abnormalities in the quantity or functioning of fibrinogen can lead to either  bleeding or clotting disorders. However, Factor V Leiden is a more  common cause of inherited thrombophilia.

## Fat Emboli

<!-- fat emboli prevention -->

Early immobilization and operative fixation of fractures reduces the  chances of fat embolism. Supportive care is the mainstay of therapy for clinically apparent fat embolism.

There is no evidence that prophylactic heparin reduces the risk of fat  embolism. The use of corticosteroid prophylaxis is controversial,  largely because it is difficult to definitively prove its efficacy in a  condition with a low incidence, unclear risk factors, low mortality, and a good outcome with conservative management.
