**Primary dysmenorrhea** is painful menses (eg, cramping) due excessive prostaglandin production (eg, inflammation) that **interferes with daily activities**.  In addition to cramping, patients often have associated fatigue, headache, and nausea.  These symptoms typically begin just prior to the onset of menstruation and generally last 2-3 days.  Primary dysmenorrhea is a clinical diagnosis based on **cyclic pelvic pain** (eg, menses) and a **normal pelvic examination** (eg, no fixed uterus or adnexal mass), suggesting no underlying pathology.  These patients can be started on empiric treatment with **combination oral contraceptives** (OCPs) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Patients with persistent symptoms despite 3 months of either NSAIDs or OCPs are started on a dual regimen.  Patients with continued pain after 3 months of dual therapy require evaluation with a pelvic ultrasound to assess for secondary causes of pain (eg, adenomyosis) **(Choice E)**.  A negative ultrasound is suggestive of endometriosis, which can be confirmed via diagnostic laparoscopy or treated empirically with a GnRH agonist (eg, leuprolide) **(Choices B and C)**.

**(Choice D)**  Medroxyprogesterone acetate is indicated for management of patients with primary dysmenorrhea who also have a contraindication to OCPs (eg, migraines with auras, hypertension, age >35 with tobacco use).  However, side effects such as weight gain limit this medication's usefulness.
