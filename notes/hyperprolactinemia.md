# hyperprolactinemia

- related: [[Endocrine]], [[prolactinoma and pregnancy]]

<!-- hyperprolactinemia causes, sx, -->

Causes of high prolactin:

- most common cause:
	- physiologic (pregnancy and lactation)
	- physiologic stress, coitus, sleep, nipple stimulation
- pathologic:
	- primary hypothyroidism
	- pituitary stalk compression
	- medications: antipsychotics, usually 25-100 ng/mL
		- metoclopramide, risperidone, phenothiazine can cause > 200ng/mL

Symptoms:

- amenorrhea, galactorrhea in premenopausal women
- men: mass effect, hypogonadism, gynecomastia

<!-- prolactinoma management -->

Management

- Discontinue offending drug for 3 days to determine whether level normalizes

- Antipsychotic drug needs to be discontinued in consultation with psychiatrist

- **Perform pituitary MRI if cannot discontinue drug** (this means everyone on antipsychotics)

- MRI pituitary indicated in all patients with unexplained high prolactin

- macroprolactinoma (â‰¥1 cm)
	- prolactin > 500 ng/mL diagnostic of macroprolactinoma
	- prolactin correlate with tumor size
	- when macroadenoma present with prolactin < 100, cause usually from stalk compression from nonfunctioning tumor and not from prolactionoma
	- dopamine agonist used as treatment
		- cabergoline: preferred, more efficacious at lowering prolactin and shrink tumor. Dosed weekly
		- bromocriptine: dosing qd to tid
	- monitor prolactin level 2-4 wks then 3-4 months
	- repeat MRI in 3 months, then every 6-12 months until stability
	- surgery not first line: 50% recur after resection
	- only consider surgery if cannot tolerate medication or fails medication

- microadnoma:
	- asymptomatic pts do not require treatment
	- premenopausal women with hypogonadism treated with OCP if do not want children or dopamine agonist if do want children
	- postmenopausal women: no treatment
	- repeat MRI in 1 year
