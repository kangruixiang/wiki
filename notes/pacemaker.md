| --- | --- | --- |
| A   | A   | I   |

| V   | V   | I   |

- 1st letter: chamber pased, atrial, ventricular, dual
- 2nd letter: sensing, atrial, ventricular, dual
- 3rd letter: inhibition
	- I: inhibit atrial on ventricular pacing
	- D: lead in A, V. Sensing in A or V. Can pace in A or V. Can inihibit. Can trigger ventricular pacing based on atrium. AV nodal ablation
- Pacing:
	- atrium: p waves
	- RV: LBBB
	- LV: RBBB
	- AV: physiologic QRS

## Indications for pacemaker

Current guidelines recommend **implantable cardioverter-defibrillator** (ICD) therapy for the **primary prevention** of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with **myocardial infarction** (MI) with persistent **left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤30%**, who are at least **40 days post-MI** and **3 months post-revascularization** (ie, coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention, if performed).  It is also recommended in those with LVEF ≤35% and NYHA class II or III symptoms, regardless of prior MI.

This patient's MI was treated with percutaneous revascularization 4 months ago, and he is on optimal medical therapy.  He has persistent left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 25%.  The most appropriate next step is to counsel and offer him ICD placement for primary prevention of SCD.
