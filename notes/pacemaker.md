- rate response: increase HR based on metabolic rate

| 1st | 2nd | 3rd |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A   | A   | I   |
| D   | D   | D   |
| V   | V   | I   |

- 1st letter: chamber pased, atrial, ventricular, dual
- 2nd letter: sensing, atrial, ventricular, dual
- 3rd letter: inhibition
	- I: inhibit atrial on ventricular pacing
	- D: lead in A, V. Sensing in A or V. Can pace in A or V. Can inihibit. Can trigger ventricular pacing based on atrium. AV nodal ablation
- Pacing:
	- atrium: p waves
	- RV: LBBB
	- LV: RBBB
	- AV: physiologic QRS
