- population:
	- age > 30
	- multiple gestation
	- preeclampsia
	- happens between 36 weeks gestation and 5 months postpartum
- symptoms: heart failure sx
- diagnosis: LVEF <45%, and no other cause of heart failure (ie, diagnosis of  exclusion)
- treatment: treat systolic heart failure. Patients who develop PPCM during pregnancy are delivered based on maternal stability.
- after delivery:
	- Some patients will have **spontaneous resolution** of ventricular dysfunction and can discontinue their medication regimen
	- **risk of recurrence** high with patients with LVEF <20% at diagnosis
	- Patients with **persistent PPCM** are at risk for further LV function decline and death in subsequent pregnancies.
	- Therefore, **regardless of PPCM resolution**, patients are evaluated with serial **echocardiograms** for a few years. Those with recurrent or persistent LV dysfunction are advised to avoid pregnancy.
