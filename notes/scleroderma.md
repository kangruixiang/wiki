## Scleroderma Crisis

<!-- scleroderma crisis symptoms, ddx, treatment -->

This patient's elevated blood pressure is clearly an acute change based on her prior blood pressure measurements. The most  likely diagnosis in this case is scleroderma renal crisis. Underlying  scleroderma should be considered in this patient given her history of  **Raynaud phenomenon and GERD**. Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) is  characterized by the abnormal deposition of collagen in multiple organ  systems. The majority of the patients have underlying renal  involvement, but overt symptoms of scleroderma renal disease are seen  less commonly. Thickening of the vessel wall and narrowing of the  vascular lumen in the renal arterioles result in ischemia, which  activates the renin-angiotensin system. This results in hypertension,  which is often as severe as **malignant hypertension**, as seen in this  patient with CNS symptoms and papilledema. It is, therefore, important  to monitor the blood pressure in scleroderma patients, and the presence  of hypertension should alert the physician to the possibility of  scleroderma renal crisis. **Acute renal failure** is also typical of  scleroderma renal crisis and is likely secondary to a combination of  severe hypertension superimposed on the abnormal renal vasculature.

Another possible cause for a sudden onset of renal crisis is renal  artery stenosis secondary to atherosclerosis. However, atherosclerosis  is unlikely in a young patient, such as this one, without atherosclerotic risk factors. A bruit is typically present in patients  with atherosclerotic disease involving the renal arteries, but a bruit  is not seen with scleroderma involvement of the kidneys because only the small arterioles are affected.

Fibromuscular dysplasia can be a cause of renal artery stenosis in young patients. However, the presence of Raynaud phenomenon and GERD make scleroderma the more likely diagnosis.

Sudden-onset renal failure can be seen in hemolytic uremic syndrome  (HUS); however, it is predominantly manifested by hematological  abnormalities, (i.e., thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic  anemia), and there is usually an accompanying history of prior  diarrhea. HUS is commonly seen in children.

Pheochromocytoma is usually associated with episodes of tachycardia, palpitations, headache, and hypertension.

ACE inhibitors are the agents  of choice in the treatment of scleroderma renal crisis since these  reverse the angiotensin-induced vasoconstriction. Most patients respond favorably if these drugs are used promptly after the diagnosis, and the goal should be to reduce blood pressure to baseline over 72 hours. The ACE inhibitor of choice in these patients is captopril, given that it  has a relatively short time to onset and is the agent with which there  is the most clinical experience for scleroderma renal crisis. ACE  inhibitors also alleviate renal failure in the majority of patients in  the long term, although they may temporarily worsen renal failure in the short term. Since ACE inhibitors result in efferent arteriole  vasodilation, there may be a mild drop in GFR and subsequent worsening  of creatinine, which is already elevated in this patient as is commonly  seen in scleroderma renal crisis. Creatinine should be closely  monitored in these patients, but generally any increase in creatinine is mild and does not warrant cessation of the ACE inhibitor. While ACE  inhibitors are generally avoided in most patients with acute renal  failure, scleroderma renal crisis is an exception to this general rule  as long as renal function is closely monitored.

Given that this patient has malignant hypertension with CNS manifestations, a second agent, such as intravenous nitroprusside, is needed to acutely  lower the patient's blood pressure. This should be done cautiously as a sudden reduction of blood pressure is not favorable because this can  further compromise renal perfusion and result in acute tubular  necrosis. Only one dose of nitroprusside is generally necessary to gain control of the patient's blood pressure acutely as the captopril takes  effect.

This patient's presentation is most consistent with systemic sclerosis,  also known as scleroderma. Many patients with scleroderma develop  pulmonary fibrosis, which is likely the cause of this patient's  shortness of breath. Pulmonary fibrosis is often associated with dry  cough and a ''velcro'' like sound on pulmonary auscultation. Many  patients with scleroderma have severe gastroesophageal reflux symptoms  due to hypomotility of the esophagus and incompetence of the lower  esophageal sphincter. A cardiac heave is sometimes found with heart  failure, which can be an additional manifestation of scleroderma. The  telangiectasias noted around this patient's lips likely represent skin  involvement of scleroderma. It is important to note that some patients  may have many of the systemic manifestations of the disease without the  characteristic skin sclerosis. Because the telangiectasias are the only skin manifestation, this patient may have the limited cutaneous  subcategory of scleroderma. Anti-centromere antibody is the  autoantibody seen most commonly with this disorder.
