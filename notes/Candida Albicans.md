# Candida Albicans

<!-- Candida albicans morphology -->

is an opportunistic **dimorphic fungus** that grows as **budding yeast cells, pseudohyphae, true hyphae, or spores**. Pseudohyphae are distinguished from true hyphae by the lack of cytoplasmic connection between cells and relative frailty.

For most dimorphic fungi, the mnemonic "mold = cold, yeast = heat" applies. _C. albicans_ is unusual because **the mold form grows at 37°C** while the yeast form (pseudohyphae and budding yeasts) predominates at 20°C.

## Germ tube test

<!-- A germ tube test is -->

A diagnostic test where a sample of fungal spores are suspended in serum and examined by microscopy for germ tubes, which is an outgrowth produced by spores from fungi during germination. **A positive germ tube test is strongly indicative of C. albicans**.

## Normal habitat

<!-- C. albicans normally found -->

Found in the **mucous membranes of respiratory, GI, and female genital tracts**, with tendencies to overgrow in warm, moist areas.

Part of the normal flora
may contaminate sputum cultures

## Overgrowth

<!-- C. albicans overgrowth symptoms -->

Can lead to:

- **Oral thrush** of the mouth that appears as a white exudate on mucous membranes.

- **Vaginitis** that presents with itching, copious secretion, and **“cottage cheese”** appearing clumps.

- **Cutaneous candidiasis** can present as a beefy red rash with satellite pustular lesions in moist intertriginous areas (where two skin areas touch) such as under the breasts, axilla of the arm, or anogenital region. This can also manifest as a diaper rash in infants.

## Oral candidiasis risk

## Vaginitis risks

<!-- Candida vaginitis risks -->

- Candies: diabetes
- Drugs: Antibiotics
- Birth control pills all risks for candida

<!-- Candida vaginitis pH -->

Vaginitis typically presents with a **normal vaginal pH less than 4.5** versus bacterial vaginosis or trichomonal vaginitis, where vaginal pH may be higher than 4.5.
Open until 4pH

<!-- Candida oral thrus vs leukoplakia -->

Oral thrush presents as **white plaques that can be removed or scraped away**. Contrast this with hairy leukoplakia, a manifestation of EBV also present in AIDS patients, which presents as **white plaques on the side of the tongue that cannot be scraped off**.

<!-- Candida in immunocompromised symptoms -->

In immunocompromised individuals, persistent infection can spread and lead to **esophagitis** and **disseminated candidiasis**, which may lead to infective endocarditis.

<!-- AIDS defining candida disease, what CD4 count -->

_Candida_ esophagitis presents as retrosternal pain upon swallowing is considered an **AIDS-defining illness**. Oral thrush is not considered AIDS-defining.
Starts seeing at CD4<100
Max 100 lbs

<!-- superficial candida vs disseminated cause -->

T-cell deficient patients are more likely to get superficial _Candida_ infections, whereas **neutropenic patients** are more likely to have disseminated candidiasis (hematogenous).

## Treatment

<!-- Candida albicans treatment -->

Treatment include:

- **Nystatin mouthwash** and **oral fluconazole** for thrush and esophagitis

- **Topical azoles** or **oral fluconazole** for vaginitis

- **Oral fluconazole** or any **IV echinocandins** for disseminated candidiasis.
  Pinecones for conazoles
  Play Nyce for oral
  Frogs, amphibians for immunocompromised
  Cap on elderly: capsofungin for immunocompromised
