## Meralgia paresthetica is a common cause of lateral thigh symptoms in obese patients.  It is caused by compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve at the waist and has been linked to tight-fitting clothing.  Patients with meralgia paresthetica may demonstrate altered sensory findings in a specific region at the lateral and anterior thigh, but the knee is spared and no tenderness is noted.

This patient’s clinical presentation is consistent with meralgia paresthetica, a pure sensory syndrome due to lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) compression.  This condition is usually seen in patients who are **pregnant, obese**, diabetic, or who wear tight pants or belts.  Patients typically present with **sensory symptoms** in the distribution of the LFCN (anterolateral thigh), which originates in the upper lumbosacral plexus (L2-L3) and runs underneath the inguinal ligament where it can frequently be compressed.

The LFCN is a pure sensory nerve, and therefore patients will not present with any symptoms of weakness.  Diagnosis is made clinically, but MRI of the lumbar spine or EMG/NCS may be needed in equivocal cases to rule out other causes.  Since meralgia paresthetica is a benign and **self-limited condition**, conservative treatment (e.g., **avoiding tight garments**, **weight loss**) improves symptoms in > 90% of patients.  Patients with persistent symptoms for > 2 months may respond to anticonvulsants (e.g., gabapentin) or local nerve block.
