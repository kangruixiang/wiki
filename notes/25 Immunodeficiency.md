<!-- ignore.. -->

|          | Cellular | Humoral          |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Adaptive | T        | B and Antibodies |
| Innate   | NK, Mo   | Complement       |

Immune deficiency types:

- B: X linked Agamma, CVID, IgA, hyper-IgM
- T: DiGeorge, HIV
- B and T: SCID, WAS, Ataxia Telangiectasis
- Phagocytosis: CGD, LAD, Chediak Higashi
- Complement: C1E def, angioedema, C5-C9

## Demographics

- Age > 6 mo: after maternal Ig gone
- recurrent infections
- severe infections with normal bugs
- unusual pathogens
- FTT with diarrhea

## Diagnosis and Treatment

- CBC with diff
- Quantitative IgA, M, G levels
- Disease specific
- Treatment disease specific

# B

## X-Linked

- aka Bruton's
- path: x-linked, A-Ig-anemia
- pt: boys
- symptoms: sinopulmonary infections at 6 mo. **Early in life**
- diagnosis
	- CBC: normal
	- Ig: **no Ig of any kind**
	- flow cyt: no B
	- confirm with RTK gene
- treatment: schedule IVIG, bm transplant

## CVID

- path: mild form of Bruton's
- pt: **teenager, older**
- diagnosis
	- CBC: normal
	- Ig: **decreased** in some Igs
- treatment: maybe IVIG, no BM transplant

## IgA

- path: low IgA
- symptoms
	- Sinopulmonary infections
	- gastroenteritis
	- Asx, anaphylaxis with transfusion
- diagnosis
	- CBC: normal
	- Ig: low IgA, increased G and M
- treatment: watch out for anaphylaxis

## Hyper IgM

<!-- hyper IgM treatment.. -->

- Path: can't convert M to G
- symptoms: nonspecific
- diagnosis
	- CBC: normal
	- Ig: low IgG/A, increased IgM
- treatment: nothing. IgM usually enough

# T

<!-- ignore.. -->

## DiGeorge

- path: 22q11.2. Third pharyngeal pouch
- symptoms
	- PE: wide spaced eyes, low set ears, absent thymic shadow, small face
	- fungi, PCP
- diagnosis
	- clinical
	- CBC: reduced lymphocytes
- treatment: prophylaxis bactrim, IVIG, thymic transplant
- f/u: hypocalcemia (tetany, seizures)

# Combined

## Wisckott Aldrich

- path: X-linked
- pt: boys
- symptoms
	- Eczema
	- low platelets
	- normal infections
- diagnosis
	- CBC: low WBC, low plt
	- Ig: Increased IgM/G (B cell work harder)
- treatment: bone marrow transplant

## Ataxia Telangiectasia

- path: DNA repair
- pt: ataxia, telangiectasia, immunodeficient
- f/u: leukemia, lymphoma

## SCID

<!-- SCID path, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment -->

- path: no immune system, defense, no B or T. ADA def. Mega-AIDS but HIV negative.,
- symptoms: infection on any exposure
- diagnosis
	- CBC: decreased WBC
	- Ig: No IgM, G, A
- treatment: isolate. Bubble baby. Bactrim. Bone marrow transplant

# Phagocytosis

<!-- ignore.. -->

## CGD

- path: no respiratory burst. Mo can't kill catalase positive
- symptoms: **recurrent staph abscesses**
- diagnosis:
	- nitro blue
	- CBC: increased WBC
	- increased IgM/G
- treatment: bone marrow transplant

## LAD

- Path: WBC can't get out blood
- symptoms: high fever, high leukocyte count, infections without no pus, delayed separation of cord
- treatment: bone marrow transplant

## Chediak Higashi

- path: AR
- diagnosis: giant granules in neutrophils
- f/u: association with albinism, neuropathy, neutropenia

# Complement

- C1 Esterase: non drug related angioedema
	- give FFP
- Nesseria infection: C5-C9 MAC
