# aspergillosis

- related: [[ID]], [[ABPA]]

## Aspergillus

- most common species: _A. fumigatus_, _A. flavus_, _A_. _niger_, and the amphotericin-resistant _A. terreus_.
- _Aspergillus_ produces disease after inhalation of airborne spores (90%) and only occasionally by traumatic skin inoculation. Of all the fungi, _Aspergillus_ is notable for the diverse settings in which it can occur and the various clinical manifestations it can produce.

## Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis

<!-- invasive aspergillosis population, pathogenesis, sx, dx, rx -->

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis:

- most often occurs in immunosuppressed patients who are neutropenic or are HSC transplant recipients
- starts in respiratory tract and then enters the circulatory system (angioinvasion). This is followed by the formation of a fungus-septic emboli complex with subsequent hematogenous dissemination.
- Sx: most commonly pulmonary aspergillosis (60%), but sinusitis, brain abscess, endocarditis, disseminated infection, and osteomyelitis also may occur.
- Dx:
	- blood cultures generally negative
	- serum [[galactomannan]] testing is recommended
	- If the serum galactomannan result is negative, but the patient has strong risk factors, bronchoalveolar lavage with galactomannan and _Aspergillus_ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are recommended, followed by tissue biopsy, if necessary, to establish a definitive diagnosis.
	- Early CT of the chest in patients with suspected invasive pulmonary aspergillosis—with typical findings suggestive of **septic emboli** (nodules, often with a “halo sign”), thromboembolic pulmonary infarction (wedge-shaped peripheral densities), or necrosis with cavitation and a crescent sign—and the serum galactomannan assay can be useful in establishing a presumptive diagnosis of invasive infection, especially in neutropenic patients and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, in whom the assay has a sensitivity of approximately 80%.
	- First-line treatment of invasive aspergillosis is with a triazole (voriconazole, posaconazole, or isavuconazole); amphotericin B deoxycholate or [[liposomal amphotericin B]] can be used for amphotericin-sensitive _Aspergillus_ species if triazoles are not available. When possible, reversal of immunosuppression improves treatment response.

## chronic necrotizing aspergillosis

<!-- ignore -->

Other forms of _Aspergillus_ infection occur in different clinical settings. Chronic necrotizing aspergillosis is a semi-invasive indolent form of infection that does not disseminate and occurs in patients who have lesser degrees of immunosuppression (such as those who take chronic glucocorticoids or those who have intrinsic immune defects) or chronic pulmonary disease. Treatment is similar to that for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

## Aspergilloma

Pulmonary aspergillomas (fungus balls consisting of hyphae, mucus, and cellular debris) may form in patients with pre-existing cavities, such as old tuberculosis cavities and in bullae of patients with COPD; the presence of significant hemoptysis is a potential complication. In the absence of associated symptoms or hemoptysis, pulmonary aspergillomas may not require therapy; however, in the setting of significant bleeding, surgical resection or embolization may be necessary. Antifungal therapy is typically not effective against pulmonary aspergillomas, and its role in aspergilloma treatment is unclear.
