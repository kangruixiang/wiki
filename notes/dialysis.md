## New dialysis

- Usually dialyze first 3 days in a row before evaluate if can stop

## Types

- CRRT: Convection
- HD: diffusion and convection 
- PD: diffusion
	- increase serum glucose = worse clearance because of less diffusion

## Ways to combat hypotension in dialysis

- Na myelin: induce hypernatremia
- albumin infusion
- lower the temperature

## Efficiency of dialysis

- measure efficiency with KT/u 
- Should have drop in BUN by 65%
- Can increase efficiency with time, blood flow, dialyzer
