- [[organophosphate]]

## Poison

**Arsenic's** first-line chelating agent is **dimercaprol** (eg, British Anti-Lewisite), which increases urinary excretion of heavy metals by forming stable, nontoxic soluble chelates.

Acute **lead** poisoning can present with constipation, anemia, and irritability and confusion.  **CaNa2EDTA** is a treatment option for lead toxicity and works by forming non-ionizing salts to increase urinary lead excretion.

**Deferoxamine** is the preferred chelating agent for **iron** overdoses or overload due to multiple blood transfusions.  It binds circulating iron and facilitates its urinary excretion.

## Stress Ulcers

<!-- stress ulcer prophylaxis indications -->

1 factor:

- Coagulopathy: platelets <50,000/mm3, INR >1.5, PTT >2x normal control
- Mechanical ventilation >48 hours
- GI bleeding or ulceration in last 12 months
- Head trauma, spinal cord injury, major burn

2 factors:

- Glucocorticoid therapy
- \>1 week ICU stay
- Occult GI bleeding >6 days
- Sepsis

This mechanically ventilated patient with recent head trauma has developed an **upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed**, as evidenced by the melenic bowel movements and anemia. This is most likely from gastric or esophageal **stress ulcers**.  Critically ill patients may have uremic toxins and reflux of bile salts into the stomach; both can disrupt the protective glycoprotein layer,  which can lead to increased permeability of the gastric mucosa,  predisposing to ulcer formation. **Head trauma** causes  increased gastrin secretion, leading to parietal cell stimulation and  acid secretion. Shock is associated with mucosal ischemia leading to  ulcerations. Most of these ulcerations occur within the first 72 hours  and tend to be located in the proximal stomach. Ulcerations occurring  later in the hospital course tend to be located in the duodenum.

**Proton pump inhibitors** (PPIs) as well as H2 antagonists are used to increase the pH in the stomach by lowering  gastric acid formation, which prevents the gastric injury associated  with ulcer formation. PPI may have increased efficacy in acid  suppression. Both PPIs and H2 antagonists may be associated with increased risk of _Clostridium difficile_ infection (CDI) and pneumonia.

## Kidney donations

<!-- kidney donations contraindications -->

- Inability to consent (age <18, intellectual
  disability, untreated psychiatric disease)
- Diabetes mellitus
- Hypertension with end-organ dysfunction
- BMI >35 kg/m2
- Malignancy

The most important factors in matching a kidney donor to a recipient include **human leukocyte antigen** (HLA) matching and **ABO compatibility**. In addition, kidney transplants from **living donors**, when available, have better outcomes than those from deceased donors.  Compared with deceased kidney donation, living donated kidneys have  longer graft survival. Finally, transplant outcomes are best when the  transplant can be performed **before** the patient requires dialysis (pre-emptive transplantation). Because living donor organs  are available sooner, the need for dialysis can be limited or avoided  entirely. Size is generally not a consideration, as transplanted  kidneys are placed in a different location from the native kidneys.

## Brain Death

## TURP

<!-- TURP complications -->

Retrograde ejaculation is the most frequent  complication of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), which is an invasive procedure used in the management of benign prostatic  hyperplasia (BPH).

Urinary tract infections and urethral strictures are also complications of TURP, but are less common.

Urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction have been described with TURP but are relatively uncommon.

## Flex Sig

<!-- flex sigmoidoscopy findings requiring colonoscopy -->

Flexible sigmoidoscopy requires less preparation and is an acceptable alternative. If findings are normal, it should be  repeated at 5-year intervals (or 10-year intervals if combined with  annual fecal immunochemical testing).

However, sigmoidoscopy does not visualize the proximal colon and is less sensitive than colonoscopy. Increased risk for **advanced neoplasia** in the proximal colon is seen with:

- **Large** (>1.0 cm) adenomatous polyps
- **Multiple** adenomatous polyps
- Polyps with **villous or tubulovillous** morphology

Therefore, all patients who have such polyps detected on sigmoidoscopy should have visualization of the entire colon with colonoscopy.

## Tetanus

<!-- tetanus vaccine when -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/image-20200127200708056.png)

Following a **mammalian bite**, the decision to administer **tetanus prophylaxis** (ie, tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine ± tetanus immune globulin) is  based on the severity of the wound and the immunization status of the  patient.

- For patients who have received ≥3 **tetanus toxoid** doses, a booster dose of tetanus toxoid is indicated only if their last tetanus dose was ≥10 years ago (for clean or minor wounds) or **≥5 years** ago (for dirty or severe wounds).
- Patients who have received <3 tetanus toxoid doses (ie, **incompletely immunized**) or whose vaccine status is uncertain should receive a tetanus toxoid  booster. If such patients have dirty or severe wounds, they should also receive **tetanus immune globulin**.

This child has severe wounds with evidence of contamination (eg, bite wound, specks of **dirt**, plant matter). However, the child is up to date on immunizations,  which means he has received at least 4 tetanus toxoid-containing  vaccines (ie, diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis \[DTaP] at age 2, 4, and 6 months and an additional DTaP at 4 years). His last dose was <5 years ago. Therefore, there is no need for either a  tetanus toxoid booster or tetanus immune globulin

## Pneumococcal

<!-- pneumococcal vaccine schedules -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/image-20200128200131482.png)

The **13-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13)** is recommended for all adults age >65; it should be followed by the **23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23)** 6-12 months later **(Choice B)**.  Sequential PCV13 and PPSV23 are also recommended for adults age <65  with certain high risk underlying conditions (eg, cerebrospinal fluid  \[CSF] leaks, sickle cell disease, cochlear implants, congenital/acquired asplenia, immunocompromise, chronic renal failure). PPSV23 alone is  recommended for adults age <65 with other chronic medical conditions  including smoking, diabetes, heart or lung disease, and chronic liver  disease.

## Coin ingestion

<!-- esophageal coin ingestion management -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/image-20200713165557688.png)

Foreign body ingestion is common in toddlers, and **coins** are the most commonly swallowed objects. Management depends on  symptoms, time of ingestion, and the type of object ingested. Children  are not reliable historians and many events are unwitnessed. A **2-view** (posteroanterior \[PA] and lateral) neck and chest x-ray confirms the  location of the foreign body and distinguishes between a coin and  battery (the latter can cause perforation in just a few hours). A coin is seen in this patient's x-ray as a **homogenous** object with a **sharp, crisp edge**; the bilaminar structure of a button battery causes a "double-ring" sign.

Children who swallow coins are often asymptomatic, but some have dysphagia and  drooling. Asymptomatic patients with coin ingestion <24 hours  earlier can be observed with repeat x-rays in 12-24 hours to ensure  passage beyond the pylorus **(Choice C)**. Children who had an **unknown time of ingestion**, such as this patient, or those who are **symptomatic** should undergo **flexible endoscopy** for coin removal. Coins lodged >24 hours are at significant risk for complications (eg, erosion, perforation).

Emergency bronchoscopy would be appropriate for an airway foreign body  causing respiratory compromise. This patient has no stridor, wheezing,  or respiratory distress and the lateral radiograph indicates that the  foreign body is in the esophagus rather than the airway. In addition,  an esophageal coin appears linear on lateral x-ray; a tracheal coin appears linear (project on end) in the PA view.

## Gout HTN

<!-- gout HTN meds -->

This patient has uncontrolled **hypertension** that has failed lifestyle interventions. Hypertension must be managed cautiously in patients with **gout**.  Most diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide) decrease the  fractional excretion of urate and should be avoided when possible **(Choice E)**. This patient's serum uric acid level is at goal, but an increase could put him at risk for further gout flares.

The angiotensin II receptor blocker **losartan** has a mild **uricosuric** effect and is effective as first-line treatment for hypertension in  patients with gout. If additional lowering of blood pressure is needed, calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine) are safe to use in gout and  work well in combination with angiotensin II receptor blockers.

**(Choice B)**  Beta blockers with alpha-blocking activity (eg, labetalol, carvedilol)  are not recommended as first-line treatment for hypertension. Beta  blockers are generally associated with an increased risk of gout flare.

## Varicocele

<!--varicocele sx, dx, rx, complications -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/image-20200716091041285.png)

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/image-20200716091222595.png)

A **varicocele** is a tortuous dilation of veins in the pampiniform plexus surrounding  the spermatic cord and testis. It occurs in nearly 20% of postpubertal  males and presents as a soft, irregular mass ("bag of worms") that  increases in size with standing and Valsalva. Varicoceles can cause  elevated scrotal temperatures, increasing the risk for **infertility** and **testicular atrophy**. Patients with varicoceles do not have an increased risk of testicular cancer.

If needed, the diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasound, which can show  retrograde venous flow and dilation of pampiniform plexus. Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment. Those with scrotal discomfort  usually improve with analgesics (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs) and/or scrotal support. Patients with testicular atrophy or  infertility may benefit from surgery to improve fertility.

The left spermatic vein drains to the left renal vein, which then passes between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta. Compression  beneath the superior mesenteric artery ("nutcracker effect") can lead to increased pressure in the spermatic vein and venous dilation. For this reason, varicoceles are more common on the left side. In contrast, the right spermatic  vein drains directly into the inferior vena cava, and right-sided  varicoceles are relatively rare. A right-sided varicocele can be a sign of malignant compression (eg, renal cell carcinoma) and therefore  warrants CT imaging. CT scan is not recommended for workup of an  isolated, left-sided varicocele.

## Acetaminophen toxicity

<!-- acetaminophen toxicity sx, dx, rx -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/image-20200717142420452.png)

**Acetaminophen poisoning** can occur  from an acute intentional ingestion of a toxic dose (150 mg/kg in  children, 7.5 g in adults). Following ingestion, patients typically go  through 4 clinical stages: nonspecific symptoms or **asymptomatic** (0-24 hours), **hepatotoxicity** (24-72 hours), peak of liver function abnormalities (72-96 hours), and recovery (4-14 days).

Patients who present within 4 hours of ingestion are given activated charcoal for gastric decontamination **(Choice A)**.  Acetaminophen level is then obtained at 4 hours post-ingestion, and the level is correlated with the time since ingestion on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine whether the antidote, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), is  required. Levels are not measured <4 hours after ingestion because  they are unreliable and poor predictors of toxicity.

If presentation is **4-24 hours** after ingestion, as in this patient, acetaminophen concentration is measured immediately, and **empiric NAC** is administered while awaiting the results. Prompt administration of  NAC is recommended, even in asymptomatic patients, ideally before the  onset of liver injury, as this antidote is highly effective in  preventing hepatotoxicity. Aspartate transaminase, alanine  transaminase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine are measured to assess for hepatic injury and hepatorenal syndrome. If the **acetaminophen level** remains above the treatment line on the nomogram, NAC is continued.

Liver failure is rare in children and adolescents  who receive NAC early. Although those with fulminant hepatic failure  and hepatic encephalopathy may require liver transplantation, this  patient is currently asymptomatic and should first receive NAC.

Except in rare cases, gastric lavage is not recommended for gastric  decontamination due to the significant risk for aspiration pneumonia.

## Obesity

<!-- obesity management --> 

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/image-20200717143334032.png)

This patient has failed to improve with an adequate  trial of dietary modification. In addition, she has continued to gain  weight and now meets the definition of **obesity** (BMI >30 kg/m2). In light of the risk of obesity-related complications, pharmacologic therapy is indicated.

Initial medication options for patients with obesity are listed in the flow chart. **Orlistat** inhibits pancreatic lipases, resulting in decreased fat absorption. It is frequently chosen as a first-line drug due to its excellent safety  profile and choice of low-dose (over-the-counter) and high-dose  (prescription) options. However, orlistat is associated with  significant gastrointestinal side effects (eg, diarrhea, bloating, fecal incontinence), and some patients may elect to start with another  medication.

## GBS

<!-- GBS sx, dx, rx -->

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/image-20200718092330205.png)

This patient with paresthesias, autonomic dysfunction, shortness of breath, and symmetric motor weakness likely has **Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)**.

GBS is an acute, immune-mediated polyneuropathy due to cross-reacting  antibodies against peripheral nerve components. Most cases are preceded by a gastrointestinal (eg, _Campylobacter_) or respiratory infection. Major manifestations include:

- Progressive **symmetric motor weakness** (usually beginning in the legs)
- **Hyporeflexia**
- Paresthesias
- **Autonomic dysfunction** (eg, palpations, orthostatic hypotension)
- Respiratory, facial, and/or oropharyngeal muscle weakness

The diagnosis of GBS is largely clinical, but suspicion is supported by  characteristic cerebrospinal fluid (high protein with normal leukocytes) and electrodiagnostic studies. Treatment with intravenous  immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis can shorten time to recovery. Most  patients recover completely but some have residual neurologic sequelae.

## DAN

<!-- diabetic autonomic neuropathy is -->

This patient most likely has **overflow urinary incontinence** (OUI) due to **diabetic autonomic neuropathy** (DAN). In patients with longstanding diabetes mellitus, microvascular  damage often leads to neuropathy affecting the autonomic nervous  system. Autonomic parasympathetic innervation controls contraction of  the detrusor muscle during urination; **impaired detrusor muscle contraction** due to DAN or other autonomic nerve injury (eg, spinal cord trauma, multiple sclerosis) leads to **urinary retention**, elevated intravesicular pressure, and eventually OUI. This patient's orthostatic hypotension provides additional evidence of autonomic impairment due to DAN.
