**Lithium**, a mineral salt used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, has a **narrow therapeutic index** (ie, the clinically effective dose is only slightly lower than the dose at which it becomes toxic). Lithium is eliminated exclusively by the  kidneys and also passes across cell membranes via transport proteins  that normally handle sodium and potassium. As a result, medications  that suppress the glomerular filtration rate or affect potassium and  sodium levels can increase lithium levels and lead to potential drug  toxicity. **Thiazide diuretics**, **angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,** and **angiotensin II receptor blockers** can **increase serum lithium levels**.  Calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine) are usually considered safe  as they do not significantly affect sodium levels or glomerular  filtration rate.
