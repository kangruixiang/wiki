# mitral valve prolapse

Mitral prolapse occurs when **excess mitral valve leaflet tissue** or **myxomatous degeneration of valve components** causes the mitral valve leaflets to **balloon into the left atrium during systole**.

**Anxiety and panic disorders** have been associated with mitral valve prolapse.

Myxomatous degeneration is an **increase in spongiosa** (composed of _dermatan sulfate_) and a **decrease in fibrosa** (which has more tensile strength) which results in redundant valvular tissue.

**Connective tissue** disorders such as [[ehlers danlos]], [[marfan]], or osteogenesis imperfecta predispose to mitral valve prolapse. [[Turner syndrome]]

### Symptoms

The majority of patients are **asymptomatic**, but some may complain of **palpitations** and **chest pain**.

<!-- mitral valve prolapse murmur -->

Cardiac auscultation in patients with **mitral valve prolapse** (MVP) typically reveals a **nonejection click** due to snapping of the mitral chordae as the valve cusps extend into the atrium during systole, followed by a **soft late systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation**. The click varies with maneuvers (earlier with decreased left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), later with increased LVEDV).

Standing and valsalva **decrease preload, reducing the LVEDV** and relieving the chordae tendineae of some tension. This makes the click occur **earlier in systole**.

Squatting **increases preload, augmenting the LVEDV** and placing greater tension on the chordae tendineae. This makes the click occur **later in systole**.

### Diagnosis

<!-- ignore -->

**Echocardiography** is the most useful tool in diagnosing and evaluating MVP. It can determine the degree of prolapse, severity of mitral valve thickening, presence and amount of regurgitation as well as other determinants of cardiac function such as LVEF.

Like any cardiac valvular disease, mitral valve prolapse may predispose to endocarditis, but it is very rare and **the current recommendation is against antibiotic prophylaxis**.

Asymptomatic patients should be **reassured that their condition is benign**.
