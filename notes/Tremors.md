- dopamine inhibits GABA that inhibits movement
- Ach stimulates GABA that inhibits ovement
- Parkinson: no D2 from substantia niagra
- risk increases with welders: indoor, Mg heavy metal consumption

### Symptoms

Criteria:

- **Bradykinesia**: everything slower. Finger taps, mask liked faces, migrographia
- **cogwheel rigidity**
- **resting tremor,** only 75% of patients: pill rolling. Tremor comes back when put hands up
- **gait instability**
- symptoms worse with stress/anxiety, decreased sleep, caffeine, after exercise
- Dysutonomia: conspitation most common, depression, hypotension

### Diagnosis

- Clinical, no imaging

### Treatment

- Ach-i for young people. Do not use amantadine
- COMT, MAO-B, L-DOPA/carbidopa, dopamine agonists
- dopamine agonist SE: **impulse control**, nausea, VH, leg edema, hypersomnolence
- worse parkinson with antidopamine drugs: reserpine, antipsychotics, anti emetics

Management, pt comes in:

- if <70, functional: start with dopamine agonists
- if > 70, or dysfunctional: L-DOPA/Carbidopa, MAO/COMT adjunct
- DBS if medications fail

## Parkinson's Plus

- bilateral, fall in 1st 2 years

### Multiple Systems Atrophy

- Dysautonomia: sweating, hypotension, bladder function
- Shy Drager: MSA-P, Parkinson like
- Olivopontocerebellar atrophy: MSA-C, cerebellar like
- treatment is aimed at intravascular volume expansion with fludrocortisone, salt supplementation, alpha-adrenergic agonists, and application of constrictive garments to the lower body.

### Progressive Supranuclear Palsy

- Bilateral, early falls, supranuclear palsy: saccade length/velocity down

### Corticobasal Degeneration/Syndrome

- bilateral, early falls, cortical signs: apraxia, aphasia, blindness, acalculus

### Lewy Body Dementia

- bilateral, early falls, VH

## Movementents

- athetosis: smalest amplitude, velocity
- Chorea: medium
- ballism: largest amplitude, velocity

## Essential Tremor

- path: familial
- symptoms: tremor with movement/use, no resting. Same tremor whole way. Hand, neck, voice, **no leg symptoms**. Handwriting large and straight
- pt: male, 40-60
- treatment: propranolol, primidone, alcohol, no response to levodopa

**Essential tremor** is exacerbated by goal-directed movements that involve extension of the arms (e.g. finger-to-nose testing, drinking from a cup).

Essential tremor is most often inherited in an **autosomal dominant** manner.

Essential tremor is **relieved by small amounts of alcohol** and is usually **not aggravated by caffeine**.

First-line treatments for patients with essential tremor include **propranolol** or **primidone**, an anticonvulsant.

Patients with essential tremor that fail pharmacologic therapy are candidates for **deep brain stimulation** or **thalamotomy**.

## Intention Tremor

- path: cerebellar dysfunction
- symptoms: no tremor at rest, tremor with movement, worse closer with target
- diagnosis: clinically
- treatment: no treatment

## Physiologic Tremor

Physiologic tremor is a benign tremor with low amplitude and high frequency (12-14 Hz) that is not visible under ordinary conditions.  Unlike the resting tremor seen in this patient, physiologic tremors are **postural tremors** (eg, holding arms outstretched) and infrequently occur with action.  Physiologic tremors are usually worsened with emotional or physical **stress**, toxic/metabolic derangements, **caffeine**, or drug withdrawal.

## Orthostatic Tremors

Orthostatic tremor is a postural tremor considered to be a variant of essential tremor.  Orthostatic tremor occurs in the legs immediately on standing and is relieved by sitting down.  It is usually high frequency (14-18 Hz) without other clinical signs or symptoms.

## Huntingtons Chorea

- path: CAG repeats, anticipation, AD
- symptoms: chorea (ballistic, uncontrolled movement), depression, psychosis
- diagnosis: clinical
- treatment: none

## Restless leg

![](https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/L16390.jpg)

- causes
	- idiopathic, iron deficiency, end stage renal, pregnancy, birth control
- diagnosis
	- noncomfort sensation: like migraines in legs, not on surface/paresthesia
	- worse with rest
	- better with movement
	- worse at night
- treatment
	- augmentation: worse with dopamine treatment. No augmentation with gabapentin

# Other Movements

## Chorea

Chorea is a **hyperkinetic movement characterized by rapid, unpredictable, involuntary movements of the limbs, often described as**"**dance-like**". Chorea results from an imbalance between indirect and direct pathways in the basal ganglia, leading to increased dopaminergic activity.

Diseases associated with chorea include:

- **Hyperthyroidism**
- **Stroke**
- **Huntington disease**
- **Systemic lupus erythematosus**
- **Levodopa use**
- **Rheumatic fever**
- **Lesch-Nyhan syndrome**

**Dopamine receptor blockers** are the most effective agents to reduce the severity of choric movements. In some patients the use of second generation antipsychotics can also decrease chorea.

## Athetosis

Athetosis is characterized by **writhing, snake-like movement in extremities**, **especially the fingers**.

Diseases associated with athetosis include:

- **Cerebral palsy**
- **Encephalopathy**
- **Huntington’s disease**
- **Wilson’s disease**

Treatment of athetosis involves **treating the underlying disorder** as no one drug has been shown to reduce symptoms.

## Dystonia

Dystonia is characterized by **sustained proximal limb and trunk contractions**.

Diseases associated with dystonia include:

- **Wilson’s disease**
- **Parkinson’s disease**
- **Huntington’s disease**
- **Encephalitis**
- **Neuroleptic use,** which is itself associated with tardive dyskinesia

Treatment options for dystonia include:

- **Carbidopa**
- **Levodopa**
- **Botulinum toxin**
- **Treatment of the underlying disorder**

## Hemiballism

Hemiballismus is characterized by **flinging of a proximal extremity only occurring on one side**.

Hemiballismus is typically associated with a **lacunar stroke** affecting the**contralateral subthalamic nucleus**.

Hemiballismus is treated with **haloperidol**.

## Tics

Tics are characterized by **repetitive brief involuntary movements or sounds**.

Diseases associated with tics include:

- **Tourette syndrome**
- **Obsessive-compulsive disorder**
- **ADHD**

Treatment options for tics include:

- \*\*Tetrabenazine  \*\*(first-line)
- Antipsychotics: **risperidone**, **fluphenazine**,  pimozide ,   haloperidol
- Alpha 2 agonists: **clonidine**, **guanfacine**
