<!-- warm vs cold AIHA cause, sx, rx -->

This patient's presentation suggests ==autoimmune hemolytic anemia== (AIHA), a complication in about 10% of patients with ==systemic lupus erythematosus== (SLE).  AIHA is due to autoantibodies (warm agglutinins or IgG antibodies and cold agglutinins or IgM antibodies) destroying red blood cells.  Nearly 80% of cases of AIHA are due to warm agglutinin disease.  Patients typically present with signs and symptoms of anemia.

Laboratory findings include ==decreased hemoglobin and serum haptoglobin==, increased ==indirect bilirubin== and lactate ==dehydrogenase==, reticulocytosis, and **==spherocytosis==** on peripheral smear due to partial phagocytosis of IgG-coated red blood cells.  Spherocytosis results in ==increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration==.  Elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is due to the reticulocytosis.  Diagnosis is established by a ==positive direct antiglobulin== (Coombs') test.

==Steroids== are first-line treatment for SLE-associated AIHA, with rapid tapering after the hematocrit increases and reticulocytosis decreases.  Splenectomy is indicated if there is no response to steroids or in patients who require high-dose steroids to maintain response.
