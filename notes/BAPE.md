Building demolition carries a significant risk of asbestos exposure.  **Benign asbestos-related pleural effusions (BAPE)** are an early pleural manifestation of asbestos-related lung disease, usually occurring between 10-15 years postexposure.  They are usually small (<500 mL), often bloody, and exudative, with **eosinophilic** predominance (>10% of nucleated cells, frequently >50%).  BAPE may be asymptomatic or present with dyspnea, low-grade fever, and pleuritic chest pain.  **Spontaneous resolution** over weeks to months is the norm.  BAPE usually predates asbestos-related pleural plaques and may be a marker for future development of diffuse pleural thickening.
