## Orbital cellulitis

<!-- orbital cellulitis pt, patho, sx, dx, rx -->

- patient: patients with siniusitis. Children.
- pathophysiology: infection of fat and extraocular muscles of eyes
	- viridans strep, strep pneumo, staph aureus
- Sx:
	- **erythema**, **edema**, and **tenderness**, often with **impaired extraocular movement.**
	- Only orbital cellulitis involves the post-septal (ie, orbital) structures such as the extraocular muscles (**ophthalmoplegia**, **painful** eye movements) and orbital fat (**proptosis**).
- Dx: CT or MRI scan, look for abscess/purulence
- Rx: empiric IV abx **third-generation cephalosporin** (eg, ceftriaxone) or **ampicillin-sulbactam** (covers strep pneumo, viridans, H flu, staph aureus. For patients with a history of methicillin-resistant _S aureus_ or whose clinical presentation is severe, **vancomycin** should be added.
	- Surgery for abscess

**Orbital cellulitis** is more concerning and can be differentiated from the less serious, but more common, preseptal cellulitis by identifying signs or symptoms suggestive of intra-orbital inflammation.
