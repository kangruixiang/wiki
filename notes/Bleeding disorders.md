<!-- intrinsic vs extrinsic bleeding disorders -->

- Intrinsic bleeding disorder
	- prolonged PTT
	- hemophilia A(8)/B: nl PT, bleeding time, plt count
		- replace with DDAVP and aminocaproic acid for hemophilia A
		- can also give factor 8
	- vWF: increased PTT and bleeding time
		- riscocetin test for diagnosis
		- DDAVP and aminocaproic acid
- Extrinsic bleeding disorder
	- prolonged PT/INR
- vitamin K, coumadin: 2, 7, 9, 10, C, S
	- both intrinsic and extrinsic. Factor 7 shortest half life, so PT goes up first

## Acquired coagulation factor inhibitors

<!-- acquired coagulation factor inhibitor sx, examples -->

| Hemoglobin     | 12.5 g/dL   |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Platelet count | 240,000/mm3 |
| PT             | 12 seconds  |
| aPTT           | 58 seconds  |

The coagulation studies reveal a normal PT and a prolonged **aPTT**, which  is indicative of an **intrinsic pathway disorder** and is the typical  pattern seen in patients with hemophilia A and B, von Willebrand  disease, and certain acquired disorders. Because the X-linked recessive hemophilias are rare in female patients and this woman has no prior  history of bleeding suggestive of von Willebrand disease, her bleeding  disorder is most likely the result of an acquired coagulation factor  inhibitor. Examples of coagulation factor inhibitors include  antiphospholipid antibodies (which cause thrombosis) and inhibitors of  factors VIII, IX, and XI. Antibodies to factor VIII (''acquired  hemophilia'') can result in potentially severe bleeding, and can occur  independently or be associated with malignancy, pregnancy, lymphoproliferative disorders, or rheumatic disease.
