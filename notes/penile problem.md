<!-- priapism management -->

**Priapism** is a  persistent (eg, >4 hr), painful erection. It is characterized by  impaired outflow from the corpora cavernosa, leading to acidosis,  anoxia, and tissue ischemia. Priapism is a medical emergency that can  lead to irreversible ischemic injury if not corrected promptly. Common  risk factors for ischemic (low-flow) priapism include  phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil), intracavernosal  injections (eg, alprostadil), certain medications (eg, trazodone), and  sickle cell disease.

The diagnosis of ischemic  priapism can be confirmed by blood gas analysis of a corporeal  aspirate. At the onset of symptoms, priapism may be terminated with  simple interventions (eg, urination, cold compresses), but symptoms  lasting >4 hours require invasive treatment **(Choice E)**. **Aspiration** of the corpora cavernosa (often followed by irrigation with cold  saline) is advised, with intracavernosal injection of an alpha agonist  (eg, **phenylephrine**) if aspiration does not rapidly relieve the symptoms.
