This patient with a family history of cirrhosis has  fatigue, poor libido (possibly due to secondary hypogonadism), mild  elevations in hepatic transaminases, and an elevated ferritin and  transferrin saturation. This presentation is concerning for possible **hereditary hemochromatosis** (HH). HH is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by iron deposition in a variety of tissues, leading to multisystem organ damage.  Clinical manifestations usually start to appear in the 4th to 6th  decade, with women presenting later due to menstrual iron loss.

The initial evaluation of HH includes serum **iron studies**, which show increased levels of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation. The diagnosis can be confirmed with **genetic testing** for hemochromatosis-associated mutations (eg, _HFE_).  Liver biopsy is not required but may be useful to stage the extent of  liver involvement (eg, in patients with significant liver function test  abnormalities) or to confirm the diagnosis in patients who have evidence of iron overload but negative results on the standard _HFE_ gene markers. Long-term management of hemochromatosis involves serial phlebotomy to deplete excess iron stores.

Autoimmune hepatitis is associated with elevated titers of antinuclear  and anti-smooth muscle antibodies. This disorder can also cause  extrahepatic manifestations (eg, arthritis, pericarditis), but it is  usually associated with more dramatic elevations in transaminases and is much more common in women.
