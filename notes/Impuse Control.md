# Impuse Control

Impulse to start fires for no other reason than to relieve tension; the patient often experiences tension or arousal prior to the act.

# Intermittent explosive disorder

<!-- intermittent explosive disorder is, NT changes --> 

**Intermittent explosive disorder** is characterized by recurrent outbursts of aggression/anger that are **out of proportion** to the triggering event.,

According to one set of criteria, intermittent explosive disorder can be diagnosed in a patient who has behavioral outbursts that **do not result in damage of property or physical injury to animals or other individuals** if these outbursts occur at least two times per week for a period of three months.

**Low levels of serotonin**, particularly in the limbic system, are associated with intermittent explosive disorder.

Serotonin acts in the **prefrontal cortex** and assists in the s**uppression of aggressive behaviors**. A deficiency of serotonin can contribute to disinhibition of aggression and can thus contribute to the type of outbursts seen in patients with intermittent explosive disorder. Decreased levels of serotonin are also seen in patients with clinical anxiety, depression, and Parkinson disease.
