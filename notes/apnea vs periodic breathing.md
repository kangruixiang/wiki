# apnea vs periodic breathing

<!-- apnea vs periodic breathing -->

Periodic breathing is a **physiologic** breathing  pattern characterized by **pauses of 5-10 seconds** in breathing  followed by **rapid**, **shallow breaths**. Without stimulation or  intervention, a regular rhythm of breathing resumes after several cycles of periodic breathing, as in this patient.

This benign breathing pattern is thought to be secondary to recurrent central apnea due to  immaturity of the nervous system in infants up to age 6 months. There  is no associated cyanosis, change in tone, or abnormal limb/eye  movements. In addition, signs of respiratory distress, such as  retractions, nasal flaring, and persistent tachypnea, are not present in infants with periodic breathing. The irregular breathing pattern and  brief pauses in breathing may cause alarm in caregivers; reassurance is  indicated.

**Apnea of prematurity** is characterized  by true apnea and pauses in breathing lasting â‰¥20 seconds; it typically  resolves by a corrected gestational age of 37 weeks (ie, at 1 week of  life for a 36-week gestation infant). This infant's pauses in breathing are brief (occurring several times per minute), and his age makes apnea of prematurity unlikely.
