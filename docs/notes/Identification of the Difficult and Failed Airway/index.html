<h2 id="introduction" tabindex="-1">Introduction</h2>
<p>Although both difficult and failed airways are discussed in this chapter, the two concepts are distinct. A difficult airway is one in which identifiable anatomical attributes predict technical difficulty with securing the airway. A failed airway is one for which the chosen technique has failed, and rescue must be undertaken. Obviously, there is much overlap, but it is important to keep the two notions distinct.</p>
<p>In addition, one can think about airway difficulty in two categories: an anatomically difficult airway and a physiologically difficult airway. The former presents anatomical or logistical barriers to successful airwaymanagement, whereas the latter requires the operator to optimize overall patient management in the context of critically low oxygen saturation, blood pressure, or metabolic derangement, such as severe metabolic acidosis. This chapter focuses on the anatomical issues related to airway management, and the term “difficult airway,” throughout this manual, refers to airways with anatomical or logistical difficulties for airway management. Chapter 32 discusses the approach to the physiologically compromised patient, whichsome authors refer to as a physiologicallydifficult airway.</p>
<p>A difficult airway is one for which a preintubation examination identifies physical attributes that are likelyto make laryngoscopy, intubation, bag-maskventilation(BMV), the use of an extraglottic device (e.g., laryngeal mask airway [LMA]), or surgical airway management more difficult than would be the case in an ordinary patient without those attributes. Identification of a difficult airway is a key component of the approach to airway management for anypatient and is a keybranchpoint onthe mainairwayalgorithm(see Chapter 3). The key reason for this is that, depending on the degree of predicted difficulty, one should not administer a neuromuscular blocking medication to a patient unless one has a measure of confidence that gas exchange can be maintained if laryngoscopy and intubation fail. Accordingly, if an anatomically difficult airway is identified, the difficult airway algorithm is used.</p>
<p>A failed airway situation occurs when a provider has embarked on a certain course of airway management (e.g., rapid sequence intubation[RSI]) and has identified that intubationby that method is not goingto succeed, requiringthe immediate initiationof a rescue sequence (the failed airway algorithm, see Chapter 3). Certainly, in retrospect, a failed airway can be called a difficult airway because it has proven to be difficult or impossible to intubate, but the terms “failed airway” and “difficult airway” must be kept distinct because they represent different situations, require different approaches, and arise at different points in the airway management timeline. One way of thinkingabout this is that the difficult airway is something one anticipates and plans for; the failed airway is something one experiences (particularly if one did not assess for, and anticipate, a difficultyairway).</p>
<p>Airways that are difficult to manage are fairly common in emergency practice. Difficult direct laryngoscopy (DL), defined as a grade III or grade IV laryngoscopic view, occurs in approximately 10% of all adult emergency intubations. The incidence is drastically lower when a video laryngoscope is used (see Chapter 14 Video Laryngoscopy). However, the incidence of overall intubation failure is quite low, that is, less than 1%. Intubation failure can occur in a setting where the patient can be oxygenated by an alternative method, such as by BMV or using an EGD, or in a setting where the patient can be neither intubated nor oxygenated. The incidence of the “<em>can’t</em> intubate, <em>can’t</em> oxygenate” (CICO) situation in preselected operating room intubations is rare, estimated to occur once in 5,000 to 20,000 intubations. The true incidence is unknown in emergency intubations, but it is likely substantially more common, given patient acuity, lack of preselection, and a higher rate of difficult airway markers. Rescue cricothyrotomy most often happens in the setting of a <em>can’t</em> oxygenate failed airway, but its incidence has declined with the advent of video laryngoscopy (VL) and various rescue devices. Based on large registry data of adult intubations, rescue surgical airways occur in 0.3% to 0.5% of all encounters. This chapter explores the concepts of the failed and the difficult airway in the setting of emergency intubation. Recognizing the difficult airway in advance and executing an appropriate and thoughtful plan, guided by the difficult airway algorithm (see Chapter 3), will minimize the likelihood that airway management will fail. Furthermore, recognizing the failed airway promptly allows use of the failed airwayalgorithmto guide selectionof a rescue approach.</p>
<h2 id="the-failed-airway" tabindex="-1">THE FAILED AIRWAY</h2>
<p>Afailed airwayexists whenanyof the followingconditions is met:</p>
<ol>
<li>Failure to maintain acceptable oxygen saturation during or after one or more failed laryngoscopic attempts (CICO) <em>or</em></li>
<li>Three failed attempts at orotracheal intubation by an experienced intubator, even when oxygensaturationcanbe maintained <em>or</em></li>
<li>The single “best attempt” at intubationfails inthe “Forced to Act” situation(see below).</li>
</ol>
<p>Clinically, the failed airway presents itself in two ways, dictating the urgency created by the situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can’t Intubate, Can’t Oxygenate: There is not sufficient time to evaluate or attempt a series of rescue options, and the airway must be secured immediately because of an inabilityto maintainoxygensaturationbyBMVor withanEGD.</li>
<li>Can’t Intubate, Can  Oxygenate: There is time to evaluate and execute various options because the patient is oxygenated.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important way to avoid airway management failure is to identify in advance those patients for whom difficulty can be anticipated with intubation, BMV, insertion of an EGD, or cricothyrotomy. In the “Forced to Act” scenario, airway difficulty is apparent, but the clinical conditions (e.g., combative, hypoxic, rapidly deteriorating patient) force the operator’s hand, requiring administration of RSI drugs in an attempt to create the best possible circumstances for tracheal intubation, with immediate progression to failed airway management if that one best attempt is not successful (see Chapter 3).</p>
<h2 id="the-difficult-airway" tabindex="-1">THE DIFFICULT AIRWAY</h2>
<p>According to the main emergency airway management algorithm, RSI is the method of choice for any non-crash airway when airway management difficulty is not anticipated. This requires a reliable and reproducible method for identifying the difficult airway. This evaluation must be expeditious, easyto remember, and complete.</p>
<p>Inclinical practice, the difficult airwayhas four dimensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Difficult laryngoscopy</li>
<li>Difficult BMV</li>
<li>Difficult EGD</li>
<li>Difficult cricothyrotomy</li>
</ol>
<p>A distinct evaluation is required for difficult laryngoscopy, difficult BMV, difficult EGD, and difficult surgical airway management, and each evaluation must be applied to each patient before airwaymanagement is undertaken(Fig. 2-1).</p>
<h2 id="difficult-laryngoscopy%3A-lemon" tabindex="-1">Difficult Laryngoscopy: LEMON</h2>
<p>The concept of difficult laryngoscopyand intubationis inextricablylinked to poor glottic view; the less adequate the glottic view, the more challengingthe intubation. This concept, developed during an era when almost all intubations were done by DL, appears to hold true even in the era of VL. Nearly all research relating certain patient characteristics to difficult or impossible intubation is based on studies of DL. VL is much less affected than DL by the presence or number of difficult airway attributes. With the exception of severely reduced mouth opening such that the device is unable to be inserted or sudden unanticipated device failure, it is rare for VLto yield a Cormack and Lehane grade III (or worse) glottic view. VLaccomplishes this independently of the need to align the various airway axes, as must occur during DL (see Chapters 13 and 14). Difficult laryngoscopy and intubation are uncommon, even rare, when certain video laryngoscopes are used. It follows that evidence-based guidelines for prediction of difficult VL may be challenging, or even impossible, to develop. Pending further information, however, we recommend performing a difficult laryngoscopy assessment, using the LEMON mnemonic, on all patients for whom intubation is planned, including for planned VL.<img src="https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/Aspose.Words.a11f7327-5c27-4328-b516-1d6b132750c8.004.png" alt=""></p>

<p><a href="#_page3_x383.76_y726.36">Corm</a>ack and Lehane introduced the most widely used system of categorizing the degree <a href="#_page3_x383.76_y726.36">of visualiz</a>ation of the larynx during laryngoscopy, in which an ideal laryngoscopic view is designated grade 1 and the worst possible view, grade 4 (## Fig. 2-2## ). Cormack–Lehane (C–L) view grade 3 (only the epiglottis is visible) and grade 4 (no glottic structures are visible) are highly correlated with difficult or failed intubation. C–Lgr<a href="#_page3_x46.08_y659.40">ade 1 (</a>visualization of virtually the entire glottic aperture) and grade 2 (visualization of the p<a href="#_page3_x46.08_y659.40">osterio</a>r portion of the cords or the arytenoids) are not typically associated with difficult intubation. The C–Lgrading systemdoes not differentiate precisely the degree to which the laryngeal aperture is visible during laryngoscopy: A grade 2 view may reveal little of the vocal cords, or none at all if only the arytenoids are visible. This led to adoption of a grade 2a/2b system, wherein a 2a shows any portion of the cords and a 2b shows only the arytenoids. Grade 2a airways perform comparably to those scored as grade 1, whereas grade 2b airways behave more like grade 3 airways. Grade 2b accounts for only about 20% of grade 2 views. However, when a grade 2b view occurs, two-thirds of patients are difficult to intubate, whereas only about 4% of patients withgrade 2a views are characterized as difficult intubations. Agrade 1 view reveals virtually the entire glottis and is associated withnearlyuniversal intubationsuccess.</p>
<p>Despite scores of clinical studies, no evidence to date has identified a full-proof set of patient attributes that, when absent, always predicts successful laryngoscopy and, when present, indicates certain intubation failure. In the absence of a proven and validated system that is capable of predicting intubation difficulty with 100% sensitivity and specificity, it is important to develop an approach that will enable a clinician to quickly and simply identify those patients who <em>might</em> be difficult to intubate so an appropriate plan can be made using the difficult airway algorithm. In other words, when asking the question, “Does this patient’s airway warrant using the difficult airway algorithm, or is it appropriate and safe to proceed directly to RSI?,” we value sensitivity (i.e., identifying all those who might be difficult) more thanspecificity(i.e., always beingcorrect whenidentifyinga patient as difficult).</p>
<p>The mnemonic LEMON is a useful guide to identify as many of the risks as possible as quickly and reliably as possible to meet the demands of an emergency situation. The elements of the mnemonic are assembled from an analysis of the difficult airway prediction instruments in the anesthesia, emergency medicine, and critical care literature. The mnemonic, which we developed for The Difficult Airway Course and the first edition of this book, has been externally validated in ED patients. The modified LEMON (all aspects of LEMON except the Mallampati score and thyromental distance) has undergone additional external validation and been found to have very high negative predictive value for both conventional and video laryngoscopy. LEMON has now been adopted as a recommended airway assessment tool in Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS). The mnemonic is as follows:</p>

Most of the litany of physical features associated with difficult laryngoscopy and intubation (e.g., small mandible, large tongue, large teeth, and short neck) are accounted for by the remaining elements of LEMON and so do not need to be specifically recalled or sought, which can</h2>
<p>be a difficult memory challenge in a critical situation. The external look specified here is for the “feeling” that the airway will be difficult. This feeling may be driven by a specific finding, such as external evidence of lower facial disruption and bleeding that might make intubation difficult, or it might be the ill-defined composite impression of the patient, such as the obese, agitated patient with a short neck and small mouth, whose airway appears formidable even before any formal evaluation (the rest of the LEMON attributes) is undertaken. This “gestalt” of the patient is influenced by patient attributes, the setting, and clinicianexpertise and experience, and likelyis as valid for VLas for DL.</p>
<h2 id="e%E2%80%94%23%23-evaluate-3-3-2%3A-this-step-is-an-amalgamation-of-the-much-studied-geometric" tabindex="-1">E—## <em>Evaluate 3-3-2:</em> This step is an amalgamation of the much-studied geometric</h2>
<p>considerations that relate mouth opening and the size of the mandible to the position of the larynx in the neck in terms of likelihood of successful visualization of the glottis by DL. This concept originally was identified with “thyromental distance,” but has become more sophisticated over time. The thyromental distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle, the two legs being the anteroposterior dimension of the mandibular space, and the interval between the chin–neck junction (roughly the position of the hyoid bone indicating the posterior limit of the tongue) and the top of the larynx, indicated by the thyroid notch. The 3-3-2 evaluation is derived from studies of the geometrical requirements for successful DL, that is, the abilityof the operator to create a direct line of sight fromoutside the mouth to the glottis. It is not known whether it has any value in predicting difficult VL, for which no straight line of sight is required. The premises of the 3-3-2 evaluationare as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mouth must open adequately to permit visualization past the tongue when both the laryngoscope blade and the endotracheal tube are withinthe oral cavity.</li>
<li>The mandible must be of sufficient size (length) to allow the tongue to be displaced fullyinto the submandibular space duringDL.</li>
<li>The glottis must be located a sufficient distance caudad to the base of the tongue that a direct line of sight can be created from outside the mouth to the vocal cords as the tongue is displaced inferiorlyinto the submandibular space.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first “3,” therefore, assesses mouth opening. A normal patient can open his or her mouthsufficientlyto accommodate three of his or her ownfingers betweenthe upper and lower incisors (## Fig. 2-3A## ). In reality, this is an approximate measurement as it would be unusual to ask an acutely ill or injured patient to stick three fingers in his or her mouth. If a patient is able to comply,<a href="#_page6_x46.00_y568.00"> ask if </a>he or she can open the mouth as wide as possible. This will give a meaningful sense o<a href="#_page6_x46.00_y568.00">f wheth</a>er the patient is able to open fully, partially, or not at all. The second “3” evaluates the length of the mandibular space by ensuring the patient’s ability to accommodate three of his or her own fingers between the tip of the mentum and chin–neck junction (hyoid bone) (## Fig. 2-3B## ). The “2” assesses the position of the glottis in relation to the base of the tongue. The space between the chin–neck junction (hyoid bone) and the thyroid notch should accom<a href="#_page5_x90.00_y493.00">modate</a> two of the patient’s fingers (## Fig. 2-3C## ). Thus, in the 3-3-2 rule, the first 3 assesses the ad<a href="#_page5_x90.00_y493.00">equacy </a>of oral access, and the second 3 addresses the dimensions of the mandibular space to accommodate the tongue on DL<a href="#_page5_x90.00_y493.00">. The a</a>bility to accommodate significantly more than or less than three fingers is associated<a href="#_page5_x90.00_y493.00"> with gr</a>eater degrees of difficulty in visualizing the larynx at laryngoscopy: The former because the length of the oral axis is elongated, and the latter because the mandibular space may be too small to accommodate the tongue, requiring it to remain in the oral cavity or move posteriorly, obscuring the view of the glottis. Encroachment on the submandibular space by infiltrative conditions (e.g., Ludwig angina) is identified during this evaluation. The final 2 identifies the location of the larynx in relation to the base of the tongue. If significantly more than two fingers are accommodated, meaning the</p>
<p>larynx is distant fromthe base of the tongue, it may be difficult to reach or visualize the glottis on DL, particularly if a smaller blade size is used initially. Fewer than two fingers may mean that the larynx is tucked up under the base of the tongue and may be difficult to expose. This conditionis oftenimpreciselycalled an“anterior larynx.”<img src="https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/Aspose.Words.a11f7327-5c27-4328-b516-1d6b132750c8.008.png" alt=""></p>

<p>oropharyngeal structures are visible when the mouth is fully open and the tongue is extruded reflects the relationships among mouth opening, the size of the tongue, and the size of the oral pharynx, which defines access through the oral cavity for intubation, and that these relationships are associated with intubation difficulty. Mallampati’s classic assessment requires that the patient sit upright, open the mouth as widely as possible, and protrude the tongue as far as possible without phonating. ## Figure 2-4##  depicts how the scale is constructed. Class I and class II patients have low intubation failure rates; so the importance withrespect to the decisionwhether to use n<a href="#_page7_x46.00_y564.00">euromus</a>cular blockade rests with those in classes III and IV, particularly class IV, where i<a href="#_page7_x46.00_y564.00">ntubation </a>failure rates may exceed 10%. By itself, the scale is neither sensitive nor specific; however, when used in conjunction with the other difficult airway assessments, it provides valuable information</p>
<p>about access to the glottis through the oral cavity. In the emergency situation, it frequently is not possible to have the patient sit up or to follow instructions. Therefore, often only a crude Mallampati measure is possible, obtained by examining the supine, obtunded patient’s mouth with a tongue blade and light, or by using a lighted laryngoscope blade as a tongue depressor on the anterior half of the tongue to gain an appreciation of how much mouth opening is present (at least in the preparalyzed state) and the relationship between the size of the tongue and that of the oral cavity. Although not validated in the supine position using this approach, there is no reason to expect that the assessment would be significantly less reliable than the original method with the patient sitting and performing the maneuver actively. The laryngoscope or tongue blade should not be inserted too deeply because this may incite a gag reflex and can place a supine and compromised patient at riskfor vomitingand aspiration.<img src="https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/Aspose.Words.a11f7327-5c27-4328-b516-1d6b132750c8.010.png" alt=""></p>

The four cardinal signs of upper airway obstruction are muffled voice (hot potato voice), difficulty swallowing secretions (because of either pain or obstruction), stridor, and a sensation of dyspnea. The first two signs do not ordinarily herald imminent total upper airway obstruction in adults, but critical obstruction is much more imminent when the sensation of dyspnea occurs. Stridor is a particularly ominous sign. The presence of stridor is generally considered to indicate that the airway has been reduced to &lt;50% of its normal caliber, or to a diameter of 4.5 mmor less. The management of patients with upper airway obstruction is discussed in Chapter 36.

<p>Chapter 9 highlights the importance of BMV in airway management, particularly as a rescue maneuver when orotracheal intubation has failed.

Women in third- trimester gestation are also a prototype for this problem because of their increased body mass and the resistance to diaphragmatic excursion caused by the gravid uterus. Pregnant or obese patients also desaturate more quickly, making the bag ventilation difficulty of even greater import (see Chapters 37 and 40). Difficulty bagging the obese patient is not</p>
<p>caused solelybythe weight of the chest and abdominal walls but also the resistance bythe abdominal contents to diaphragmatic excursion. Obese patients also have redundant tissues, creating resistance to airflow in the upper airway. This explains the recent association with OSA and difficult mask ventilation. Similarly, obstruction caused by angioedema, Ludwig angina, upper airway abscesses, epiglottitis, and other similar conditions will make BMVmore difficult. Ingeneral, soft tissue lesions (e.g., angioedema, croup, and epiglottis) are amenable to bag-and-mask rescue if obstruction occurs, but not with 100% certainty. Similarly, laryngospasm can usually be overcome with good bag- and-mask technique. In contrast, firm, immobile lesions such as hematomas, cancers, and foreignbodies are less amenable to rescue byBMV, whichis unlikelyto provide adequate ventilationor oxygenationif total obstructionarises inthis context.</p>

<p>EGD. First, redundant tissues in the pharynx may make placement and seating of the</p>
<p>device more difficult. Usually, this is not a significant problem. More importantly, obese</p>
<p>patients require higher ventilation pressures, largely because of the weight of the chest</p>
<p>wall and abdominal contents. The former causes resistance to ventilationbyincreasingthe pressures required to expand the chest, and the latter causes resistance to ventilation by increasing the pressures required to cause the diaphragm to descend. Depending on the EGD chosen and positioning of the patient (it is better to attempt ventilation with the patient 30° head up or in reverse Trendelenberg position), ventilation resistance may exceed the ability of the EGD to seal and deliver the necessary pressures.

The mnemonic SMART is used to quickly assess the patient for features that may indicate that a cricothyrotomy might be difficult.

<ul>
<li>When intubation is indicated, the most important question is “Is this airway difficult?” The decision to perform RSI, for example, is based on a thorough assessment for difficulty (LEMON, ROMAN, RODS, and SMART) and appropriate use of the main or difficult airway algorithms. Because most emergency department patients will have</li>
</ul>
<p>some degree of difficulty after a bedside assessment, the decision to use neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) is a complex one that takes into account the degree of difficulty, the urgency for tube placement, available difficult airway tools, especially VL, and one’s own skill and experience. Basically, to use NMBA, the operator must be confident that oxygenation can be maintained, and that intubation is likely to be successful, usingthe planned approach. See Chapter 3 for further details.</p>
<ul>
<li>If LEMON and ROMAN are assessed first, in order, then each component of RODS also has been assessed, with the exception of the D: distorted anatomy. In other words, if LEMON and ROMAN have identified no difficulties, then all that remains for RODS is the question: “If I insert this EGD into the pharynx of this patient, will the device be able to seat itself and seal properlywithinrelativelynormal anatomy?”</li>
<li>The ability to oxygenate a patient with a bag and mask or an EGD turns a potential “can’t intubate, can’t oxygenate” situation requiring urgent cricothyrotomy into a “can’t intubate, <em>can</em> oxygenate” situation, in which many rescue options can be considered. The ability to prospectively identify situations in which oxygenation using an EGD or a bag and mask will be difficult or impossible is critical to the decision whether to use</li>
</ul>
<p>NMBAs.</p>
<ul>
<li>No single indicator, combination of indicators, or even weighted scoring system of indicators can be relied on to guarantee success or predict inevitable failure for oral intubation. Application of a systematic method to identify the difficult airway and then analysis of the situation to identify the best approach, given the anticipated degree of difficulty and the skill, experience, and judgment of the individual performing the intubation, will lead to the best decisions regarding how to manage the particular clinical situation. In general, it is better to err by identifying an airway as potentially difficult, onlyto subsequentlyfind this not to be the case, thanthe other wayaround.</li>

Difficult intubation was defined as any encounter requiring two or more attempts. In other words, the LEMON assessment is most helpful when completely normal and indicates that nearly all patients would be candidates for RSI if truly LEMON-negative. Individual elements, taken in isolation, are less helpful and should never constitute the basis of a difficulty airway assessment. The gestalt of difficulty provided by the patient obviously is an intuitive notion and will vary greatly with the skills and experience of the intubator. There are no studies, of which we are aware, that assess the sensitivity or specificity of this first, quick look. We are not aware of the true origin of the 3-3-2 rule. It probably originated from a group of Canadian difficult airway experts, led by Edward Crosby, MD, but, to our knowledge, it was not published before we included it in the first edition of our book in 2000. The 3-3-2 rule has three components. The first is mouth opening, a long-identified and intuitively obvious marker of difficult DL. The second and third pertain to mandibular size and the distance from the floor of the mandible to the thyroid notch. Many studies suggest identifying decreased (and, to a lesser extent, increased) thyromental distance as a predictor of difficult DL. One study identified that it is relative, but not absolute, thyromental distance that matters; in other words, the</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>relevant thyromental distance that predicts difficultydepends onthe size of the patient.13 This reinforces the notion of using the patient’s own fingers as a size guide for thyromental distance, but also for the other two dimensions of the 3-3-2 rule. Hyome<a href="#_page15_x574.92_y721.79">nt</a>al distance has also been used, but seems less reliable, causing researchers to explore the value of repeated measurements and ratios involving different head and neck</p>
<p>positions.14 The eponymous Mallampati evaluation has been validated multiple times. The modified Mallampati score, the four-category method that is most familiar, was found h<a href="#_page15_x574.92_y747.35">ig</a>hly reliable in a comprehensive meta-analysis of 42 studies, but the authors emphasize, as do we, that the test is important, but not sufficient in evaluating the</p>

The safety of performing preintubation assessment is reinforced by this practice, however, as difficult and failed BMV and intubation in this population generally are unexpected because of the prescreening, and so probably reasonably predict unexpected (i.e., not detected by preintubation assessment of difficulty) similar events during emergency intubation.

The four cardinal signs of upper airway obstruction are muffled voice (hot potato voice), difficulty swallowing secretions (because of either pain or obstruction), stridor, and a sensation of dyspnea. The first two signs do not ordinarily herald imminent total upper airway obstruction in adults, but critical obstruction is much more imminent when the sensation of dyspnea occurs. Stridor is a particularly ominous sign. The presence of stridor is generally considered to indicate that the airway has been reduced to &lt;50% of its normal caliber, or to a diameter of 4.5 mmor less.

In a recent multicenter prospective intubation registry in Japan, 3,313 patients, for whom a difficult airway assessment was performed and who were intubated using DL, the modified LEMON had a sensitivity of 86% and a negative predictive value of 98% for difficult laryngoscopy. Difficult intubation was defined as any encounter requiring two or more attempts. In other words, the LEMON assessment is most helpful when completely normal and indicates that nearly all patients would be candidates for RSI if truly LEMON-negative. Individual elements, taken in isolation, are less helpful and should never constitute the basis of a difficulty airway assessment. The gestalt of difficulty provided by the patient obviously is an intuitive notion and will vary greatly with the skills and experience of the intubator. There are no studies, of which we are aware, that assess the sensitivity or specificity of this first, quick look. We are not aware of the true origin of the 3-3-2 rule. It probably originated from a group of Canadian difficult airway experts, led by Edward Crosby, MD, but, to our knowledge, it was not published before we included it in the first edition of our book in 2000. The 3-3-2 rule has three components. The first is mouth opening, a long-identified and intuitively obvious marker of difficult DL. The second and third pertain to mandibular size and the distance from the floor of the mandible to the thyroid notch. Many studies suggest identifying decreased (and, to a lesser extent, increased) thyromental distance as a predictor of difficult DL.
