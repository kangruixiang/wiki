<!-- types of chemical burns, symptoms.. -->
<p>Chemical burns are typically due to either a strong acid or an alkali.</p>
<p>Alkali and acid burns present differently.</p>
<p>Alkali burns are usually full thickness and cause the skin to appear pale and feel slippery.</p>
<p>On the other hand, acid burns are usually partial-thickness. Patients usually develop <strong>erythema</strong> and <strong>erosion</strong>.</p>
<!-- chemical burns treatment.. -->
<p>Alkali and acid burns are treated with tap water and surgery if necessary.</p>
<p>Burns should be irrigated with tap water before arriving to the emergency department.</p>
<p>Water may not completely resolve an alkali burn, in which case, surgery will be necessary.</p>
<p>Unlike the treatment of other acidic burns, hydrofluoric acid burns should be <strong>covered with calcium gluconate gel</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Polyethylene glycol, in addition to water irrigation</strong>, may be used to treat a phenol burn by increasing the latter’s solubility.</p>
<h1>Electric</h1>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>Electric shock and burn occurs via current flow through the body.</p>
<p>Young men and children are disproportionately injured.</p>
<p>Both the type of current and the amount of voltage affect the extent of damage from a shock.</p>
<p>The skin is a barrier to injury from electric shock.
However, wet skin and breaks in the skin both reduce this resistance.</p>
<!-- electrical shock symptoms.. -->
<p>Electric shocks cause general, neurologic, orthopedic, and cardiovascular clinical findings.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>General clinical findings: Pain, fatigue, and headache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neurologic clinical findings: Nervous irritability, seizures, deafness, and blindness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orthopedic clinical findings: <strong>Shoulder dislocation and femoral neck fractures</strong>, for example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cardiovascular clinical findings: ectopic beats, sinus tachycardia, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, asystole, and ventricular fibrillation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Electrical burns to internal organs may be hidden by small external burn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skin necrosis and sloughing may not occur for days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third spacing of fluid occurs with internal organ injury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rhabdomyolysis can occur.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- electrical shocks management.. -->
<p>Electrical shocks are managed by freeing the patient from the current either by turning off the power, severing the wire, or by prying them or hitting them away with a non-conductive material (e.g. wooden board).</p>
<p><strong>Cardiac and ventilatory statuses</strong> should be checked immediately. CPR must be initiated if necessary.</p>
<p>Electrical burns are treated conservatively.</p>
<p>Give an intravenous <strong>infusion of crystalloid solutions</strong> if the patient is in circulatory shock.
Acidosis may require the infusion of intravenous bicarbonate therapy.
Mannitol may be given to those with very low urine output.
A fasciotomy may be necessary, but the full extent of an electrical burn may not be apparent until 7-10 days after the burn.</p>
<h1>Burns</h1>
<!-- burn microbes, symptoms, treatment.. -->
<p><strong>Severe burns</strong> disrupt the skin barrier and create an avascular, immunologically poor, protein-rich substrate for the growth and proliferation of bacteria and fungus.  Immediately after a severe burn, gram-positive organisms (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>) from hair follicles and sweat glands dominate; after more than 5 days, most infections are due to <strong>gram-negative</strong> organisms (eg, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>) or fungi (eg, <em>Candida</em>).</p>
<p>Wound infections are common, and patients with large surface area (<strong>&gt;20%</strong>) burns are at highest risk.  The earliest sign is usually a <strong>change in appearance</strong> (partial-thickness injury turns into a full-thickness injury) of the wound or the loss of a viable skin graft.  <strong>Burn wound sepsis</strong> can develop rapidly and is associated with some or all of the following <strong>systemic findings</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature less than 36.5 C (97.7 F, as in this patient) or more than 39 C (102.2 F)</li>
<li>Progressive tachycardia (&gt;90/min)</li>
<li>Progressive tachypnea (&gt;30/min)</li>
<li>Refractory hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg)</li>
</ul>
<p>Oliguria, unexplained hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, and mental status changes are also common.  Diagnosis requires <strong>quantitative wound culture</strong> (&gt;105 bacteria/g of tissue) and <strong>biopsy for histopathology</strong> (to determine tissue invasion depth).  Treatment involves empiric, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (eg, piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenem) with the addition of potential coverage for methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (eg, vancomycin) or multidrug-resistant <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> (eg, an aminoglycoside).  Local wound care and debridement are usually necessary.</p>
<h2>Initial Management</h2>
<!-- burn initial management.. -->
<p>The initial management of burn injuries is identical to the management of all trauma patients - airway, breathing and circulation must always be secured first.  Burn victims are at high risk for respiratory compromise because the <strong>supraglottic airway</strong>, which efficiently exchanges heat with inhaled air, is very susceptible to <strong>direct thermal injury and acute obstruction by edema and blistering</strong>.  (In contrast, the subglottic airway is protected from injury by reflexive closure of the vocal cords upon exposure to extremely hot air.)  Clinical indicators of thermal and smoke inhalation injury include: burns on the face, singeing of the eyebrows, oropharyngeal inflammation, blistering or carbon deposits, carbonaceous sputum, stridor, carboxyhemoglobin level &gt;10%, and a history of confinement in a burning building.  All burn victims should be treated <strong>initially with high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask</strong>, though caregivers should maintain a <strong>low threshold for intubatio</strong>n in any patient with physical evidence of thermal damage to the upper airway.  A key reason for early intubation is that progressive airway edema may preclude intubation later in the patient's clinical course, potentially necessitating an emergent surgical airway.</p>
