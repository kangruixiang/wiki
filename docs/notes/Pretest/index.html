<h2>Bells Palsy</h2>
<!-- Bells palsy cause, treatment, prognosis. What is infantile bells palsy?.. -->
<ul>
<li>Cause: HSV, Herpes Zoster, Lyme, follow recent URI</li>
<li>Treatment consists of maintaining moisture to the affected eye (especially at night) to prevent keratitis.</li>
<li>Prognosis: Complete, spontaneous resolution occurs in about 85% of cases, 10% of cases have mild residual disease, and about 5% of cases do not resolve.</li>
<li>Infantile: Occasionally infants will have a facial nerve palsy at birth; this is usually related to compression from forceps and spontaneously resolves over several weeks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SSSS</h2>
<!-- staphylococcal scalded skin disease demographics, symptoms, labs, treatment.. -->
<ul>
<li>Demographic: seen most commonly in children less than 5 years of age.</li>
<li>Symptoms: The rash is preceded by fever, irritability, erythema, and extraordinary tenderness of the skin. Circumoral erythema; crusting of the eyes, mouth, and nose; and blisters on the skin can develop. Intraoral mucosal surfaces are not affected. Peeling of the epidermis in response to mild shearing forces (<strong>Nikolsky sign</strong>) leaves the patient susceptible to problems similar to those of a burn injury, including infection and fluid and electrolyte imbalance.</li>
<li>Labs: Cultures of the bullae are negative, but the source site or blood often may be positive.</li>
<li>Treatment includes antibiotics (to cover resistant S aureus) and localized skin care.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prophylactic Heart Antibiotics</h2>
<!-- Heart conditions to give prophylactic antibiotics.. -->
<p>Among those currently recommended to receive antibiotic prophylactic treatment are patients for whom any heart infection would result in the highest incidence of adverse outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>previous history of endocarditis</li>
<li>prosthetic valve or material for repair</li>
<li>heart transplant patients</li>
<li>severe or partially repaired congenital heart defects</li>
</ul>
<h2>Human Bites</h2>
<!-- Human bites result and management.. -->
<p>They can become <strong>infected with oropharyngeal bacteria</strong>, including <strong>S aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Bacteroidesspp, and anaerobes.</strong> A patient with an infected human bite of the hand requires <strong>hospitalization</strong> for appropriate drainage procedures, Gram stain and culture of the exudate, vigorous cleaning, debridement, and appropriate antibiotics.</p>
<p><strong>The wound should be left open</strong> and allowed to heal by secondary intention (healing by granulation tissue rather than closure with sutures).</p>
<h2>Animal Bites</h2>
<!-- animal bites management and infection cause.. -->
<p>Most experts suggest a short course of antibiotics should be started for <strong>cat, human, or monkey bites but not dog bites</strong>. Only 4% of dog bites become infected (and therefore do not necessarily need antibiotic prophylaxis), <strong>Pasteurella multocida</strong> is a common organism in infected <strong>cat and dog bites</strong>.Treatment with oral amoxicillin-clavulanate or erythromycin is recommended. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended.</p>
<h2>Meningococcal vs HSP</h2>
<!-- meningococcal vs HSP symptoms.. -->
<p>HSP also has blood in urine.</p>
<h2>Encopresis</h2>
<!-- encopresis is, demographics, retentive vs non retentive, treatment.. -->
<ul>
<li>definition: passage of feces in inappropriate locations after bowel control would be expected (usually older than 4 years).</li>
<li>demographics: Seen both with chronic constipation and overflow incontinence (retentive encopresis), and without constipation (nonretentive encopresis). Retentive encopresis is more common</li>
<li>There is leakage of liquid stool around a large fecal impaction, resulting in fecal soiling.</li>
<li>Treatment involves clearing the fecal mass, maintaining soft stools for a short period of time with mineral oil or stool softeners (3-6 months), and behavioral modification. Most children will grow out of this condition.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Genu varum</h2>
<!-- genu varum is, demographics, treatment. What is Blount disease, symptoms, labs, treatment.. -->
<p>Bowlegs:</p>
<ul>
<li>demographics: is a common finding in infants and toddlers younger than 2 years of age.</li>
<li>treatment: Improvement occurs spontaneously with time, and most children have straight legs by the time they are 2 years old.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blount:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few children with bowlegs, however, continue to progress and worsen, and in some cases the bowing is unilateral. This is termed <strong>Blount disease</strong> and is characterized by an abnormality in the medial aspect of the proximal tibial epiphysis.</li>
<li>Labs: Radiographically there is a prominent step abnormality with beaking at the proximal tibial epiphysis.</li>
<li>Treatment: Aggressive treatment is essential, as the disease can be rapidly progressive and lead to <strong>permanent growth disturbances</strong>. Bracing can be effective up to the age of 3; later correction may require surgery. Blount disease can occur in several forms: infantile (ages 1-3 years), juvenile (ages 4-10 years), and adolescent (age 11 years and older). Clinically, the findings are the same; in the adolescent group, radiograph findings are less prominent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Osgood-Schlatter</h2>
<!-- osgood-schlatter path, pt, symptoms, treatment -->
<ul>
<li>path: Repeated microfracture of the tibial tubercle at the insertion of the patellar tendon. This is an overuse injury</li>
<li>pt: young athletes</li>
<li>symptoms: presents with swelling and knee pain localized to the tubercle.</li>
<li>treatment: Improvement occurs with rest.,</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gonococcal Arthritis</h2>
<!-- gonococcal arthritis symptoms.. -->
<ul>
<li>pt: adolescent</li>
<li>symptoms: arthritis and significant systemic signs and symptoms, including chills, fever, migratory polyarthralgia, and rash, are commonly seen</li>
</ul>
<h2>Breath Holding Spells</h2>
<!-- 2 types of breath holding spells. symptoms, treatment.. -->
<ul>
<li>path
<ul>
<li>Cyanotic spells when upsetting or scolding the child.</li>
<li>Pallid breath-holding spells are less common and are usually caused by a painful experience (such as a fall)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pt: cyanotic spells are before 6 months of age, peak at about 2 years of age, and resolve by about 5 years of age.</li>
<li>symptoms: the child became cyanotic, unconscious, and had generalized clonic jerks. A few moments later the child awakened and had no residual effects.</li>
<li>treatment: Avoidance of reinforcing this behavior is the treatment of choice.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Diabetes</h2>
<!-- diabetes diagnosis criteria.. -->
<p>The criteria for diagnosis of diabetes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a fasting glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL</li>
<li>a 2-hour plasma glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test ≥ 200 mg/dL</li>
<li>symptoms of diabetes mellitus plus a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cyanide poisoning</h2>
<!-- cyanide poisoning pt, symptoms, treatment -->
<ul>
<li>pt: a rodenticide still found in some rural areas. A more common exposure occurs in fire victims</li>
<li>symptoms: The child first had a headache, but then became agitated and confused; while you are talking to the father in the ER the child begins to have a seizure and dysrhythmia on the cardiac monitor. The blood gas demonstrates a severe metabolic acidosis.</li>
<li>treatment: rapid treatment with antidote kit along with high levels of oxygen potentially are life saving.,</li>
</ul>
<h2>Neonatal Pneumonia</h2>
<!--  An 8-hour-old infant develops increased respiratory distress, hypothermia, and hypotension. A complete blood count (CBC) demonstrates a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2500/μL with 80% bands. The chest radiograph is shown below. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis <img src='https://i.imgur.com/BROvf43.png' alt='_' /> ..-->
<ul>
<li>temperature instability, left shift CBC: infectious pneumonia instead of TTN or diaphgragmatic hernia</li>
<li>rapid onset of symptoms: chlamydia presents after weeks</li>
<li>syphilis causes pneumonia but has other features: hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, rashes, hemolytic anemia, and others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>GBS</h2>
<!-- GBS onset symptoms, labs, treatment.. -->
<ul>
<li>symptoms: The rapid onset of the symptoms (hours)</li>
<li>labs: low WBC count with left shift, and the depicted chest x-ray findings are typical of a patient with group B streptococcus (GBS) pneumonia</li>
<li>treatment: Appropriate management would include rapid recognition of symptoms, cardiorespiratory support, and rapid institution of appropriate antibiotics.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strabismus</h2>
<!-- 2 ways to screen infant for strabismus. Treatment. When to refer to ophthalmologist.. -->
<p>Light reflection</p>
<p>Infants can be screened for strabismus by observing the location of a light reflection in the pupils when the patient fixes on a light source. Normally, it should be in the center or just nasal of the center in each pupil.</p>
<p>Cover-Uncover</p>
<p>Another method of testing for strabismus is the “cover” or “coveruncover” test, using the principle that children with strabismus will use the “good” eye for fixation. By covering the good eye, the other eye will deviate.</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>The aim of treatment is to prevent loss of central vision from foveal suppression of a confusing image in the deviating eye. This is accomplished by surgery, eyeglasses, or patching of the normal eye.</p>
<p>Persistence of a transient or fixed deviation of an eye beyond 4 months of age requires referral to an ophthalmologist.</p>
<h2>Water temperature</h2>
<!-- water temperature.. -->
<p>Water temperature should be set to about 49°C (120°F); this will minimize the risk of accidental scald burns.</p>
<h2>Milk consumption</h2>
<!-- milk consumption at 2 yo.. -->
<p>In the older (2 yo) child, limiting fat to less than 35%, saturated fats and polyunsaturated fats each less than 10% of total calories, and cholesterol intake to less than 100 mg/1000 kcal/d usually results in switching from <strong>whole to skim or low-fat milk.</strong></p>
<h2>DTAP CI</h2>
<!-- DTaP contraindication.. --> 
<p>For the DTaP, another contraindication is the occurrence of encephalopathy (such as coma, altered level of consciousness,
or prolonged seizures) within 7 days of administration of the previous dose.</p>
<h2>Head Lice</h2>
<!-- head lice bug, symptoms, treatment.. -->
<ul>
<li>bug: peduculosis capitis</li>
<li>symptoms: intense itching</li>
<li>treatment
<ul>
<li>permethrin rinse. <strong>Do not use lindane</strong> for 2 month old because of neurotoxicity</li>
<li>Use of 1:1 vinegar-water rinse for hair for nit removal</li>
<li>Washing of all clothing and bedding in very hot water</li>
<li>Replacement of all commonly used brushes</li>
<li>Advice to the mother that treatment will again be necessary in 7 to 10 days</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LkINu1K.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>TB Meningitis</h2>
<!-- long lingering meningitis.. -->
<ul>
<li>TB lingers for 3 weeks or longer</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cholesteaoma</h2>
<!-- cholesteaomx path, symptoms, treatment.. -->
<ul>
<li>path: A cholesteatoma may be congenital or acquired.</li>
<li>symptoms: It is a small sac lined with epithelium-containing debris. Acquired cholesteatoma can present in children with <strong>recurrent otitis media</strong>, or in the face of a <strong>chronically draining ear.</strong> The mass can grow aggressively, leading to <strong>CNS complications</strong> like facial nerve damage, hearing loss, and intracranial extension.</li>
<li>treatment: Referral to an otolaryngologist is required; a CT scan of the temporal bones can define the extent of disease.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Arsenic</h2>
<!-- arsenic antidote.. -->
<p>Antidote is DMSA</p>
<h2>Clonidine</h2>
<!-- clonidine child overdose symptoms and treatment.. -->
<ul>
<li>miosis, bradycardia, and hypotension. Apnea, respiratory depression</li>
<li>Treatment includes aggressive PICU support and naloxone (which has variable effect).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fragile X</h2>
<!-- fragile x symptoms -->
<p>The physical features become more obvious after puberty. They include a long face, large ears, prominent jaw, macroorchidism, hypotonia, repetitive speech, gaze avoidance, and hand flapping. Even in the absence of physical findings, boys of all ages with developmental delay, autism, and abnormal temperament of unknown cause probably should be tested.,</p>
<h2>Seizures</h2>
<!-- most common cause of infant seizure, how, treatment.. -->
<ul>
<li>path: The most helpful historical detail for acute management of this patient is the <strong>dilution of the formula</strong>, especially in light of the history of poor growth. Over time, inappropriate dilution can cause hyponatremia and water intoxication, leading to seizure activity.</li>
<li>treatment: Slow correction of the sodium is curative. The technique used to correct the patient’s hyponatremia depends on the etiology. In this case the child likely has chronic hyponatremia from poor intake. If the child continues to seize, 3% sodium chloride may be used to rapidly increase serum sodium and, theoretically, decrease cerebral edema. Otherwise, starting the child on a regular formula and eliminating excess water will correct the deficiency over time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Craniotabes</h2>
<!-- craniotabes is, sign of -->
<ul>
<li>sign of rickets</li>
<li>Soft occiptal bone, buckle under pressure like ping pong ball.,</li>
</ul>
<h1>Frost</h1>
<!-- cold exposure problems and ddx.. -->
<p><em>Frostnip</em> appears as <strong>blanching</strong> of the skin with transient numbness and paresthesias that <strong>resolves with rewarming</strong>. It is characterized by lack of ice crystal formation in the tissues and <strong>absence of tissue loss</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Trench foot</em> results from prolonged exposure to a <strong>wet nonfreezing cold environment</strong> that produces peripheral <strong>neurovascular damage</strong> without ice crystal formation. This neurovascular damage manifests as pain, paresthesia, pallor, pulselessness, and paralysis. Trench foot is a reversible condition if diagnosed and treated early. Patients with trench foot have a better prognosis than patients with frostbite.</p>
<p><strong>Frost bite</strong>: same as above two but with gangrene and ischemia of tissues.</p>
<p><em>Pernio (chilblains/cold sore)</em> is less severe than trench foot and consists of <strong>painful inflammatory skin</strong> lesions caused by <strong>chronic</strong> repeated exposures to damp, nonfreezing cold temperatures. It is characterized by <strong>localized edema, erythema,</strong> plaques, nodules, vesicles, or bullae that appear as long as 12 hours after the injury. It is more common in young women.</p>
<p>Hypothermia, defined as core body temperature of less than 35°C, usually occurs as a concurrent disease.</p>
<h2>Frostnip</h2>
<!-- frostnip is, cause, treatment -->
<p>Small, firm, <strong>white</strong>, <strong>cold</strong> patches of skin in exposed areas; treatment is <strong>rewarming the areas</strong> before they become numb.,</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4jXxfWH.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Trench Foot</h2>
<!-- trench foot is, cause, symptoms, prognosis -->
<p>Occurs with prolonged exposure to cold and/or moisture. The foot will become cold, numb, pale, edematous, and clammy. A prolonged autonomic disturbance after this condition can persist for years.,</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SRduhkr.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Frostbite</h2>
<!-- frostbite is, cause, symptoms, prognosis -->
<p>Condition in which tissue is frozen and destroyed. There is initial stinging, followed by aching, culminating in numb areas. Once rewarmed, the area becomes red, blotchy, and painful. Gangrene may develop.,</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/upi6ld1.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Chilblains</h2>
<!-- Chilblains are, result, compared to frostnip.. -->
<ul>
<li>path: Small, ulcerated lesions on exposed areas such as the ears and fingers. Lesions may last <strong>1 to 2 weeks</strong>.</li>
<li>symptoms: symptoms of chilblains and frostnip are actually quite different.  Chilblains presents with slight swelling of the toes and redness.  The toes and forefoot have a dull ache that is not relieved by rest.  With frostnip the affected skin blisters and has a red, brown or wheat colored crust.  Pain is described as a burning type of pain.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Vitamin Excess</h1>
<!-- vit a excess symptoms -->
<ul>
<li>Vitamin A: slows normal growth and causes <strong>hyperostosis</strong> (excess bone growth), <strong>hepatomegaly</strong>, increased <strong>ICP</strong> (headache, vomiting), and <strong>drying of skin</strong> (desquamation, alopecia, itching).,</li>
</ul>
<!-- niacin excess symptoms -->
<ul>
<li>Nicotinic acid (niacin): a vasodilator, causes skin <strong>flushing</strong> and <strong>pruritus</strong>; long-term use can cause tachycardia, liver damage, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia.,</li>
</ul>
<!-- vitamin c excess symptoms -->
<ul>
<li>Vitamin C: in addition to causing kidney stones, diarrhea, and cramps, also causes an increase the normal requirement for the vitamin when large doses are discontinued.,</li>
</ul>
<!-- vitamin D excess symptoms -->

<h1>Urinary Tract</h1>
<h2>Labial Adhesion</h2>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<ol start="278">
<li>You are seeing a 4-year-old girl with the physical examination finding shown below. She has no significant past history. The most appropriate management is which of the following?</li>
</ol>
<p>b. Estrogen cream</p>
<!-- labial adhesion is, cause, treatment -->
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WiJ7LI4.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>A usually benign condition in which the labia minora are fused. Fusion ranges from a small area to the entire area between the clitoris and the fourchette.</li>
<li>Cause and demographics: It is most common in young girls who are in the low estrogen state of preadolescence. Sometimes urine pooling can cause an increased risk of urinary tract infection.</li>
<li>Treatment can be merely observation, as the condition should resolve with the estrogenization that occurs with puberty. Nightly application of an estrogen cream for a week resolves this condition in the majority of patients. However, as recurrence is common, patients must be instructed to apply daily petrolatum for a month or two after separation.,</li>
</ul>
<h2>Estrogen Withdrawal</h2>
<!-- At the 2-week checkup of a term female infant, the mother reports a grayish and sometimes bloody vaginal discharge since birth. The infant’s mother and grandmother are the only caretakers. Examination of the external genitalia reveals an intact hymen with a thin grayish mucous discharge. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?.. -->
<p>This patient has a physiologic discharge related to estrogen withdrawal. Examination can exclude vaginal trauma, and the history makes sexual abuse unlikely. Imaging is not indicated at this point. Parents should be reassured that it will resolve in a few weeks.</p>
<h2>Prune Belly Syndrome</h2>
<!-- prune belly syndrome demographics, symptoms, inheritance -->
<ul>
<li>Demographics: a malformation that occurs mostly in <strong>males</strong></li>
<li>Symptoms: characterized by a lax, wrinkled abdominal wall, a dilated urinary tract, and intra-abdominal testes. Additional urinary tract abnormalities include significant renal dysfunction or dysplasia. Oligohydramnios and commonly associated pulmonary complications, such as pulmonary hypoplasia and pneumothorax, are seen. Congenital hip dislocation, clubfeet, and intestinal malrotation with possible secondary volvulus can occur. <strong>Cryptoorchidism association.</strong></li>
<li>Inheritance: There does not appear to be a genetic predisposition to prune belly syndrome.,</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5VQq1WW.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The delivery of a newborn boy is remarkable for oligohydramnios. The infant (pictured) is also noted to have undescended testes and clubfeet, and to be in respiratory distress. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis to explain these findings?</p>

<li>A 17-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents with the complaint of coughing up blood. He is stabilized, and his hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are 11 mg/dL and 33%, respectively. During his hospitalization, he is noted to have systolic blood pressure persistently greater than 130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg. His urinalysis is remarkable for hematuria and proteinuria. You are suspicious the patient has which of the following?</li>

</ol>
<p>c. DI</p>
<h2>Fanconi Anemia</h2>
<!-- Fanconi anemia symptoms, labs, causes.. -->
<ul>
<li>Symptoms: nonspecific findings of anorexia, polydipsia and polyuria, vomiting, and unexplained fevers,</li>
<li>Labs: Laboratory abnormalities of glucosuria,  normal blood sugar, abnormally high urine pH in the face of mild or moderate serum hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and mild albuminuria in the presence of normal serum protein and albumin</li>
<li>Inheritance: FS can be hereditary or acquired; hereditary forms are usually secondary to a genetic abnormality such as cystinosis, galactosemia, Wilson disease, and some mitochondrial abnormalities.</li>
<li>Acquired: A number of agents can cause FS, including gentamicin (or other aminoglycosides), outdated tetracycline, cephalothin, cidofovir, valproic acid, streptozocin, 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, cisplatin, ifosfamide, heavy metals (eg, lead, mercury, cadmium, uranium, platinum), paraquat, maleic acid, and glue sniffing (toluene).</li>
</ul>
<p>A 6-month-old infant has poor weight gain, vomiting, episodic fevers, and chronic constipation. Laboratory studies reveal a urinalysis with a pH of 8.0, specific gravity of 1.010, 1+ glucose, and 1+ protein. Urine anion gap is normal. Serum chemistries show a normal glucose and a normal albumin with a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Serum phosphorus and calcium are low. What is the best diagnosis to explain these findings?</p>
<h2>Glans Adhesion</h2>
<!-- The mother of a 2-year-old male child states that she has noticed white, cheeselike material arising from his foreskin and also that he cannot fully retract the foreskin behind the glans penis. Which of the following is the correct advice for this parent?.. -->
<p>Glans adhesion</p>
<p>In about 90% of boys during their first 3 years of life, adhesions between the glans and the prepuce lyse and the distal portion of the foreskin loosens, thus allowing the glans to be exposed. The collection of cellular debris under the foreskin,
extruded from under the foreskin, is sometimes deemed abnormal by parents; it requires no treatment.</p>
<h3>Phimosis</h3>
<!-- phimosis normal and abnormal when.. -->
<p>Phimosis (inability to retract the foreskin) is normal in the first years of life and is considered physiologic; inability to
retract the foreskin after an age when it would be expected (about 3 years) is considered pathologic phimosis.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qHIyJGq.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>Paraphimosis</h3>
<!-- Paraphimosis is.. -->painful condition occurring when the foreskin gets retracted and trapped behind the glans and, because of edema and venous congestion, cannot be relocated into its normal position.,
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qHIyJGq.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Vesicoureteral Reflux</h2>
<!-- ignore.. -->After her first urinary tract infection, a 1-year-old has a voiding cystourethrogram with findings shown below. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment option?
<!-- vesicoureteral reflux management.. -->
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4iT7CAf.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The radiograph shows reflux into the ureters and into the kidney, with dilation of the renal pelvis, making the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux. The higher the reflux into the renal system, especially if the renal pelvis is dilated, the more likely it is for renal damage to occur; the grading system is based upon
these radiographic observations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grade I VUR is reflux of urine into an undilated ureter.</li>
<li>Reflux into the ureter and collecting system without dilatation is called grade II.</li>
<li>Grade III lesions have dilatation of the ureter and collecting system without blunting of the calyces.</li>
<li>Grade IV lesions are characterized by blunting of the calyces</li>
<li>Grade V lesions demonstrate even more dilatation and tortuosity of the ureter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Low-grade lesions (grade I and grade II) are conservatively managed with close observation, <strong>daily low-dose antibiotics</strong>, and urinalyses and cultures <strong>every 3 to 4 months</strong>. Grade V lesions (and some grade IV lesions) require surgical reimplantation of a ureter if the findings persist. Lesions in between these two extremes are treatment dilemmas.</p>

<h2>Acute Lobar Nephronia</h2>
<!-- acute lobar nephronia is, symptoms, treatment -->
<ul>
<li>The middle of the spectrum between pyelonephritis and renal abscess.</li>
<li>Symptoms: Patients have prolonged fever curves despite appropriate antibiotics.</li>
<li>Diagnosis: A CT scan is most useful in diagnosing nephronia, but a renal ultrasound can identify the process as well.</li>
<li>Treatment is <strong>prolonged IV and then PO antibiotics</strong>. Shorter courses like the typical treatment for pyelonephritis can lead to recurrence and renal abscess.</li>
</ul>
<p>A 5-year-old girl without past history of UTI is in the hospital on antibiotics for Escherichia coli pyelonephritis. She is still febrile after 4 days of appropriate antibiotics. A renal ultrasound revealed no abscess, but a focal enlargement of one of the lobes of the right kidney. CT of the abdomen reveals a wedgeshaped area in the right kidney distinct from the normal tissue with minimal contrast enhancement. Appropriate management of this patient includes which of the following interventions?.,</p>
<h2>Headache and BP</h2>
<!-- routine BP measurement in children when.. -->
<p>Routine BP measurement is performed on children of age 3 and beyond and for subgroups of children at younger ages, including children who were premature, had frequent urinary tract infection, had umbilical artery catheters, and so on.</p>
<!-- hyptension in children symptoms.. -->
<p>Hypertension is usually asymptomatic, but with marked hypertension (that which is demonstrated by this 4-year-old) children can develop <strong>headache</strong>, dizziness, visual disturbances, irritability, and nocturnal wakening.</p>
<p>Hypertensive encepha-lopathy can be preceded or accompanied by vomiting, hyperreflexia, ataxia, and focal or generalized seizures. Isolated facial nerve palsy can be the sole manifestation of severe hypertension.</p>
<p>Isolated left ventricular hypertrophy, decreased urine output, and abdominal bruits are possible.</p>
<p>Case: A 4-year-old boy, whose past medical history is positive for three urinary tract infections, presents with a blood pressure of 135/90 mm Hg. He is likely to exhibit which of the following symptoms or signs?</p>
<p>b. headache</p>
<h2>Cryptoorchidism Risks</h2>
<!-- cryptoorchidism risks. Orchiplexi reduce risk for malignancy, sperm count, torsion, epididymitis?.. -->
<ul>
<li>Risk of testicular malignancy not eliminated by orchiplexi</li>
<li>Whether the testes are brought into the scrotum or not, the sperm count can be reduced.</li>
<li>Torsion of the testis due to excessive mobility of the undescended testis. Orchiopexy helps to
eliminate this problem.</li>
<li>The incidence of UTI and epididymitis are not affected by the position of the testes.</li>
<li>The failure of the testes to develop, and their subsequent atrophy, can be detected by 6 months of age.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pQv5JCB.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>HUS Symptoms</h2>
<!-- HUS symptoms.. -->
<ul>
<li>Ischemic changes result in renal cortical necrosis and damage to other organs such as colon, liver, heart, brain, and adrenal.</li>
<li>Gastrointestinal bleeding and obstruction, ascites, and central nervous system findings such as somnolence, convulsions, and coma can occur.</li>
<li>Lab: hemolyticuremic syndrome include low hemoglobin level, decreased platelet count, hypoalbuminemia, and evidence of hemolysis on peripheral smear (burr cells, helmet cells, schistocytes). Urinalysis reveals hematuria and proteinuria. A marked reduction of renal function leads to oliguria and rising levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Red Urine</h2>
<!-- red urine causes.. -->
<p>A number of pH-dependent substances can impart a red color to urine. Use of <strong>phenolphthalein</strong>, a cathartic agent, or <strong>phenindione</strong>, an anticoagulant, can cause red urine; ingestion of <strong>blackberries</strong>, red <strong>Kool-Aid</strong>, or <strong>beets</strong> also can lead to red coloration (“beeturia”).</p>
<h2>Vulvovaginitis</h2>
<!-- vulvovaginitis symptoms, cause, treatment.. -->
<ul>
<li>Symptoms: The <strong>discharge</strong> in nonspecific vulvovaginitis is usually brown or green and with a fetid <strong>odor</strong>. <strong>Burning</strong> with urination occurs because of contact between raw skin and urine.</li>
<li>Causes: tight-fitting clothing (including swimsuits or dance outfits), nylon undergarments, prolonged bubble baths with contamination of the vagina with soap products, use of perfumed lotions in the vaginal area, or improper toilet habits (wiping of fecal material toward rather than away from vagina).</li>
<li>Treatment: Mothers should be counseled to use only cotton underwear for young children, stop bubble baths (or at least splash fresh, clean water in the vaginal area at the end of a bath), and reemphasize wiping front to back after urination or bowel movements.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Foreign Body</h2>
<!-- Vaginal foreign body suspect step.. --> A vaginal examination under general anesthesia is usually required when a vaginal foreign body is suspected. 
<h2>Varicocele</h2>
<!-- varicocele symptoms.. -->pically, this condition is not painful but can become tender with strenuous exercise..
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7x5ORaT.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Torsion</h2>
<!-- Testicular torsion steps.. -->
<ul>
<li>emergent surgical consult</li>
<li>A Doppler flow study of testes or a radionuclide scan might be indicated if the area were painful and the diagnosis of a torsion were being entertained.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hydrocele</h2>
<!-- hydrocele management.. -->
<p>Small hydroceles usually resolve spontaneously in the first year of life. Larger ones or those that have a variable fluid level with time will likely need surgical repair.</p>
<h2>Nocturnal Enuresis</h2>
<!-- Nocturnal enuresis is, gender, normal dry age, primary vs secondary, cause, labs, treatment.. -->
<ul>
<li>Involuntary voiding at night at an age when control of micturition is expected. Demographics: The condition is more common in boys than in girls.</li>
<li>Normal: By 5 years of age, most children (90%-95%) are completely dry during the day, and 80% to 85% are dry during the night.</li>
<li>Primary nocturnal enuresis: when the child has never been dry at night</li>
<li>Secondary: when the child has had a few months of dry nights before developing enuresis.</li>
<li>Cause: In most cases, no etiology is found. A family history is common.</li>
<li>Labs: Minimal laboratory testing beyond screening urinalysis is indicated.</li>
<li>Treatment: <strong>Desmopressin</strong> is not a cure, and episodes frequently return when the medication is stopped. Spontaneous cure rates are high regardless of therapy. <strong>Therapy</strong> is aimed at reassurance to the parents that the condition is self-limited, avoidance of punitive measures, and consideration of purchasing a bed-wetting alarm.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Idiopathic Hypercalciuria</h2>
<!-- Idiopathic hypercalciuria symptoms -->
<p>Recurrent gross hematuria, persistent microscopic hematuria, and complaints of dysuria or abdominal pain (burning on urination) without initial stone formation. Over time, however, stones may form in 15% of cases.,</p>
<h2>Albumin Diuretics Combo</h2>
<!-- Reason for diuretics plus albumin injection in nephrotic syndrome.. -->
<p>Hypertension commonly accompanies glomerulonephritis, but only occasionally accompanies nephrotic syndrome. Diuretics are sometimes used in both nephrotic syndrome and glomerulonephritis with temporary effect, but are not curative. A combination of albumin infusions followed by a diuretic also has been used to temporarily decrease the edema in patients with nephrotic syndrome.</p>
<h2>Bartter Syndrome</h2>
<!-- Bartter syndrome labs, symptoms, treatment -->
<ul>
<li>labs: hypokalemia, hypercalciuria, alkalosis, hyperaldosteronism, and hyperreninemia; blood pressure is usually normal.</li>
<li>Symptoms: Clinical presentations occurring frequently between 6 and 12 months of age include failure to thrive with constipation, weakness, vomiting, polyuria, and polydipsia.</li>
<li>Treatment is aimed at preventing dehydration, providing nutritional support, and returning the potassium level to normal.,</li>
</ul>
<h1>Hematology</h1>

The platelet count is 15,000/μL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?</li>
</ol>
<p>ITP</p>
<h2>Iron vs. Lead Toxicity</h2>
<p>An 11-month-old African American boy has a hematocrit of 24% on a screening laboratory done at his well-child checkup. Further testing demonstrates: hemoglobin 7.8 g/dL; hematocrit 22.9%; leukocyte count 12,200/μL with 39% neutrophils, 6% bands, 55% lymphocytes; hypochromia on smear; free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) 114 μg/dL; lead level 6 μg/dL whole blood; platelet count 175,000/μL; reticulocyte count 0.2%; sickle-cell preparation negative; stool guaiac-negative; and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 64 fL. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation?</p>
<!-- iron vs lead toxicity same and difference.. -->
<p>When the iron available for production of hemoglobin is limited, free protoporphyrins accumulate in the blood. Levels of <strong>erythrocyte protoporphyrin</strong> (EP) are also elevated in lead poisoning. Iron-deficiency anemia can be differentiated from lead intoxication by <strong>measuring blood lead</strong>, which should be less than 10 μg/dL.</p>
<h2>TEC, Transient erythroblastopenia</h2>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>The parents of a previously healthy 2-year-old child note her to be pale and bring her to your clinic for evaluation. She currently has no fever, nausea, emesis, bone pain, or other complaints. Her examination is significant for pallor, tachycardia, and a systolic ejection murmur, but she has no organomegaly. Her complete blood count (CBC) reveals a hemoglobin of 4 g/dL, normal indices for age, a WBC count of 6.5/μL, and a platelet count of 750,000/μL. Her reticulocyte count is 0%. Coombs test is negative. Her peripheral blood smear shows no blast forms and no fragments. Red blood cell (RBC) adenosine deaminase levels are normal. A bone marrow reveals markedly decreased erythroid precursors. Which of the following is this child’s likely diagnosis?</p>
<!-- Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood epidemiology, demographics, symptoms, labs, treatment -->
<ul>
<li>Epidemiology: most common acquired RBC aplasia in children.</li>
<li>Demographics: This condition is commonly diagnosed between the ages of 1 to 3 years and some affected children have a history of a recent viral infection; however, no specific virus has been implicated (parvovirus B19 is usually specifically excluded).</li>
<li>Symptoms: Physical findings are minimal and include pallor and tachycardia.</li>
<li>Labs: Laboratory studies reveal a profound anemia and reticulocytopenia with a marked reduction in erythrocyte precursors in the marrow. RBC adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels are normal.</li>
<li>Treatment: The condition lasts for several months, and may require 1 or 2 transfusions, but ultimately is selflimited. Steroids are not helpful.,</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diamond-Blackfan</h3>
<!-- Diamond-Blackfan anemia demographics, labs, association -->
<ul>
<li>Demographics: Congenital and usually presents in infancy;</li>

<h2>Fetomaternal Transfusion</h2>
<!-- Fetomaternal transfusion case and findings, diagnosis.. -->
<p>The absence of a major blood group incompatibility and the finding of a normal reticulocyte count argue strongly in favor of a recent fetomaternal transfusion, probably at the time of delivery. A <strong>Kleihauer-Betke stain</strong> for fetal hemoglobin-containing RBCs in the mother’s blood would confirm the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Fetomaternal tranfusion: the loss of fetal blood cells into the maternal circulation</p>
<p>Case: A 2950-g (6.5-lb) black baby boy is born at home at term. On arrival at the hospital, he appears pale, but the physical examination is otherwise normal. Laboratory studies reveal the following: mother’s blood type A, Rh-positive; baby’s blood type O, Rh-positive; hematocrit 38%; and reticulocyte count 5%. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the anemia?</p>
<h3>Physiologic anemia of infancy</h3>
<!-- physiologic anemia of infancy is.. -->
<p>After birth, erythropoiesis ceases, and the <strong>progressive decline in hemoglobin</strong> values, reaching a nadir at 6 to 8 weeks of age, has been termed physiologic anemia of infancy.</p>
<!-- iron deficiency anemia in infants and sickle cell manifest when.. -->
<p>Iron-deficiency anemia can be seen in the term infant between <strong>9 and 24 months</strong> of age when the iron stores derived from circulating hemoglobin have been exhausted and an exogenous dietary source of iron has not been provided. The manifestations of sickle-cell disease do not appear until <strong>4 to 6 months</strong> of life, coincident with the replacement of fetal hemoglobin with sickle hemoglobin.</p>

<p>A 3-day-old newborn with anemia and pathologic hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy</p>
<p>A. Uniformly small microspherocyte (less than 6 μm in diameter) are typical of hereditary spherocytosis (slide A). Because of a decreased surface to volume ratio, these osmotically fragile RBCs have an increased density of hemoglobin. Although spherical RBCs also can appear in other hemolytic states (eg, immune hemolytic anemia, microangiography, ABO incompatibility, and hypersplenism), their cellular volume is only irregularly augmented. Patients with hereditary spherocytosis can present in the newborn period with anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and reticulocytosis. They may remain asymptomatic until adulthood, when they develop symptoms. After infancy, hepatosplenomegaly and gallstones are common.</p>
