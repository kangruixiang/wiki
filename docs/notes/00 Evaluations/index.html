<article><h1>00 Evaluations</h1>
<ul>
<li>Enthusiastic.  If a task is assigned to her, she will get it finished. Saves interns huge amount of time with phone calls and gathering information.</li>
<li>Excellent knowledge base. Forming her own differentials and assessment/plan. Functioning at level of intern in many patient cases.</li>
<li>Curious learner. Will look up articles and help teach the interns in the afternoons.</li>
<li>Excellent social awareness. Understand her role as a student fully. Does not overstep boundaries. An essential skill to have, this will make her an incredible intern.</li>
<li>Self improving. Will read up on patients herself even if it's not her patient. Continuously working on dynamics within team without overstepping boundaries.</li>
<li>Good presentation skill. Has all the details about the patient, both subjective and objective</li>
</ul>
<h1>Negative</h1>
<p>Next step as student:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rely less on notes when presenting. Start with really knowing a patient's problem list. The rest will fall in place. Ideally notes are references for objective data</li>
<li>Offer to help more with small tasks with residents. Can really save a lot of their time</li>
<li>Continuously work on having good team dynamics, a difficult skill but essential for residents. You will get a taste of it next year as AI when you have your own 3rd year students</li>
<li>Continue to read up on patients and their disease pathologies. The amount of knowledge isn't important but the habit every day will decide the capability as a resident and beyond.</li>
<li>Work on forming own problem list with assessment and plan.</li>
<li>Overall, excellent job on the service!</li>
</ul>
