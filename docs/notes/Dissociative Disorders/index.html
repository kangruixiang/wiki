<article><h1>Dissociative Disorders</h1>
<!-- depersonalization treatment.. -->
<p><strong>Depersonalization disorder</strong> is characterized by feelings of detachment from oneself or one’s environment. Transient depersonalization may occur during periods of severe stress, but this disorder is defined by persistent depersonalization that causes social/occupational distress.</p>
<p>Treatment is <strong>symptomatic</strong> for associated depression (SSRIs) and anxiety (SSRIs, benzodiazepines, etc.).</p>

<!-- dissociative amnesia vs fugue vs dissociative identity disorder. Treatment.. -->
<p><strong>Dissociative amnesia</strong> is an inability to recall memories due to psychiatric dissociation, usually surrounding a stressful event. The classic description is a patient who has completely intact memory except amnesia of a traumatic rape experience.</p>
<p><strong>Dissociative fugue</strong> is characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity associated with unplanned travel or wandering, usually occuring in stressful situations such as <strong>war or personal losses</strong>. The classic example is a patient who wakes up in an unfamiliar place with no recollection of who they are or how they got there.</p>
<p><em>Note: As of DSM-5, dissociative fugue is a subtype of dissociative amnesia, not a separate diagnosis.</em></p>
<p>After recovery from fugue, previous memories <strong>usually return intact</strong>; however, during the fugue episode, there is complete amnesia.</p>
<p><strong>Dissociative identity disorder</strong> (multiple personality disorder) is defined by 2 or more distinct personalities within a single patient. The classic description is a patient who receives photos of his/herself doing things the patient doesn't remember, with people the patient doesn't know.</p>
<p>Most patients have experienced prior trauma, especially <strong>child abuse</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Dissociative identity disorder</strong> has the worst prognosis of all dissociative disorders.</p>
<p>Treatment of all dissociative disorders involves <strong>psychotherapy</strong>. Sodium amobarbital or lorazepam may help patients talk more freely in an interview.</p>
