<p>Anemia of inflammation is the most common RA hematologic abnormality. Felty syndrome consists of neutropenia and splenomegaly and occurs in patients with long-standing, severe, seropositive RA. These patients are at risk for serious bacterial infection, lower extremity ulceration, lymphoma, and vasculitis. With current treatment, Felty syndrome has become rare. Patients with RA can also have a large granular lymphocyte syndrome that can progress to large granular lymphocyte leukemia. Findings overlap with Felty syndrome and include neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and recurrent infections. Patients with RA are at increased risk for lymphomas (particularly large B-cell lymphomas), and risk is correlated with disease activity.</p>
<h3>Blood Vessels</h3>
<p>A small-vessel cutaneous vasculitis occurs in a small percentage of patients with RA, leading to palpable purpura or periungual infarcts. A very rare, larger-vessel vasculitis similar to polyarteritis nodosa can affect multiple organ systems; prior to current therapy, it had a 5-year mortality of 30% to 50%.</p>

<h2>Management</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/rm/mk18_a_rm_s2">Principles of Therapeutics</a> for details on the uses, mechanisms of action, major toxicities, and/or monitoring requirements of the medications used in RA.</p>
<h3>General Considerations</h3>
<p>The 2015 ACR RA treatment guidelines (<a href="https://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Rheumatoid-Arthritis">https://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Rheumatoid-Arthritis</a>) advocate for early diagnosis and aggressive early therapy of RA to prevent irreversible cartilage and bone damage. The 2010 ACR RA classification criteria emphasize sensitivity to permit early diagnosis and institution of disease-modifying therapy (see <strong><a href="https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/rm/tables/mk18_a_rm_t13">Table 13</a></strong>). A key treatment goal is to treat to target, with the target being achievement of remission or low disease activity. Disease activity assessment involves making a measured determination using combinations of numbers of tender and swollen joints (typically utilizing 28 joints that exclude the feet), patient and physician impressions of disease activity, and, in some activity scoring systems, measurement of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. These parameters are combined into a composite score, thus assigning a disease activity ranging from remission, to low, moderate, or high. The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) are two commonly used instruments to assess disease activity and response to treatment. Treating to target in RA results in less radiographic damage, reduced cardiovascular risk, and increased work productivity compared with conventional care.</p>
<p>The 2015 ACR RA treatment guidelines can assist in making initial treatment decisions in early RA. Treatment is typically advanced at 12-week intervals with the goal of reaching remission or low disease activity as rapidly as possible. Patients who remain in remission or a low disease activity state for 6 months or longer may be able to reduce treatment intensity. Treatment decisions for established RA are more complex. An initial approach to the treatment of both early and established RA is outlined in <strong><a href="https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/rm/figures/mk18_a_rm_f06">Figure 6</a></strong>.</p>
<h3>Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs</h3>
<h4>Nonbiologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs</h4>
<h4>Related Questions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Question 63</li>
<li>Question 80</li>
</ul>
<p>Methotrexate is the anchor drug in RA, used in both monotherapy and combination therapy. It can be titrated to doses as high as 25 mg per week in partial responders; the treating physician should generally maximize methotrexate dosing before adding other agents. At doses greater than 15 mg weekly, methotrexate oral absorption approaches its effective limit; switching to subcutaneous administration allows for higher serum drug levels. Folic acid supplements minimize toxicity without diminishing efficacy. Of patients with RA taking methotrexate alone, 30% to 50% achieve remission or low disease activity.</p>
<p>Sulfasalazine, leflunomide, and hydroxychloroquine also can be used as monotherapy agents in RA. Leflunomide may be useful in those who cannot tolerate methotrexate. Hydroxychloroquine is the least potent agent but can be used in very early disease when the disease activity score is low. It is also used as part of triple therapy (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine). Data suggest that triple therapy is comparable to methotrexate combined with a tumor necrosis factor α inhibitor, except in the area of radiographic progression.</p>
<h4>Biologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs</h4>
<p>Biologic DMARDs can be used as monotherapy but are typically added to methotrexate when moderate to high disease activity persists. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors are the most frequently used biologic DMARDs; these agents have a relatively rapid onset of action and demonstrate synergy with methotrexate. The combination of methotrexate and a TNF-α inhibitor has also been shown to have a “disconnect effect,” meaning that even patients with continued clinical disease activity may demonstrate little to no damage to cartilage and bone. This effect also has been shown with rituximab or tocilizumab in combination with methotrexate. Other biologic DMARDs used in RA include abatacept (a selective T-cell costimulation modulator) and tofacitinib (a small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor).</p>
<p>Until better data are available to guide therapeutic decisions, choice of a biologic DMARD remains empiric and based on patient characteristics, including what agents should be avoided due to patient comorbidity (for example, avoiding abatacept in a patient with COPD).</p>
<h3>NSAIDs</h3>
<p>NSAIDs were once the mainstay of therapy of RA. These agents are not disease modifying and do not prevent joint damage. They are used primarily to control symptoms while waiting for the full effect of DMARDs to be realized or in patients with postinflammatory osteoarthritis.</p>
<h3>Glucocorticoids</h3>
<p>Unlike NSAIDs, glucocorticoids may have a disease-modifying effect. A recent study tested 10 mg/d of prednisone versus placebo for 2 years in combination with methotrexate; the prednisone group had no more side effects than the placebo group but gained better control of disease activity, used less methotrexate, needed fewer additional medications, and had less radiographic damage. Low-dose prednisone (5-10 mg/d) can be used to rapidly improve RA symptoms while waiting for long-term medications to become effective, or they can be used short term for disease flares. Long-term therapy with glucocorticoids, however, may be associated with substantial adverse effects including osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, and infection.</p>
<h3>Surgery</h3>
<p>Surgical therapy has become much less common in RA with current treatment strategies. However, some patients may require a synovectomy for a single persistently swollen joint, carpal tunnel release, repair of a ruptured tendon, total joint replacement (shoulder, metacarpophalangeal joints, hip, knee, or ankle), or joint fusion for a painful damaged joint (wrist or ankle). See <a href="https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/gm/mk18_b_gm_s17/mk18_b_gm_s17_1_2">MKSAP 18 General Internal Medicine</a> for a discussion of perioperative RA medication management.</p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>In rheumatoid arthritis, treating to target of remission or low disease activity results in less radiographic damage, reduced cardiovascular risk, and increased work productivity compared with conventional care.</li>
<li>Methotrexate is the anchor drug in rheumatoid arthritis; it is used as monotherapy and as a component of combination therapy.</li>
<li>Tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors are the most frequently used biologics to treat rheumatoid arthritis; they have a relatively rapid onset of action and demonstrate synergy with methotrexate.</li>
<li>In rheumatoid arthritis, NSAIDs are not disease modifying and do not prevent joint damage; they are used primarily to control symptoms while waiting for the full effect of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs to be realized or in patients with postinflammatory osteoarthritis.</li>
<li>Low-dose prednisone can be used in rheumatoid arthritis to rapidly improve symptoms until long-term medications become effective, or they can be used short term for disease flares.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p>There is an increased risk for developing RA in the first year after a first pregnancy. Breastfeeding may decrease this risk. For women with established RA, two thirds will go into remission or low disease activity during pregnancy, and one third will not improve or will get worse. Medication management is a major issue, and pregnancy plans should be discussed with any woman of childbearing age who will be placed on therapy. A discussion of RA medications in pregnancy is located in <a href="https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/rm/mk18_a_rm_s2/mk18_a_rm_s2_6">Principles of Therapeutics</a>.</p>
