<!-- opportunistic HIV infections -->
<ul>
<li>Candida</li>

<li>PCP</li>
</ul>
<!-- HIV candida when develop, sx -->
<p>Mucocutaneous <em>Candida</em> infections can occur in HIV-infected patients at relatively preserved CD4 cell counts. HIV-infected patients do not usually develop invasive <em>Candida</em> infection unless they have other risk factors, such as neutropenia. Oral candidiasis usually presents as thrush, with mucosal whitish plaques, and can be treated topically (for example, with clotrimazole troches) or with a short course of oral fluconazole. Swallowing symptoms suggest esophageal disease, which requires systemic treatment, such as fluconazole, for a longer course; a lack of treatment response is an indication for endoscopy.</p>
<!-- HIV and cryptococcus sx, dx, rx -->
<p><em>Cryptococcus</em> infection usually presents as subacute meningitis with headache, mental status changes, and fever. Because it often involves the basilar area, cranial nerve deficits may also be seen. The diagnosis can be made most swiftly by antigen testing of cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Management includes antifungal therapy and attention to increased intracranial pressure, which is usually responsible for the morbidity and mortality associated with cryptococcal meningitis.</p>
<!-- HIV and toxo when, sx, dx, rx -->
<p><em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> infection in AIDS usually presents in patients with CD4 cell counts less than 100/µL. Because it is a reactivation disease, patients are usually serology positive. Clinical presentation includes headache, fever, and focal neurologic deficits. Imaging by CT or MRI (which is more sensitive) reveals multiple ring-enhancing lesions. The differential diagnosis includes primary central nervous system lymphoma, which most often appears as a single lesion on imaging, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which is usually nonenhancing. Diagnosis of central nervous system toxoplasmosis is usually presumptive based on presentation, imaging, and response to empiric treatment.</p>
<!-- HIV MAC when, sx, dx -->
<p><em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex infection usually presents as disseminated disease in patients with CD4 cell counts less than 50/µL; symptoms and signs include fever, sweats, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and cytopenias. Blood cultures for acid-fast bacilli will usually grow <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex, but it may also be found on lymph node or liver biopsy when necessary.</p>
<!-- HIV CMV when, sx -->
<p>Cytomegalovirus most commonly presents with CD4 cell counts less than 50/µL. Cytomegalovirus retinitis, presenting with vision changes or floaters, is much more likely in AIDS than in other immunocompromised conditions, such as after transplantation. Gastrointestinal cytomegalovirus disease is also common, most often as esophagitis or colitis.</p>
<!-- HIV pts have increased risks of which malignancies caused by what? -->
<p>Patients with AIDS are also more likely to develop certain malignancies, especially those related to viruses. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, especially primary central nervous system lymphoma related to Epstein-Barr virus, is significantly increased compared with age-matched controls. Kaposi sarcoma is caused by human herpes virus type 8 and presents as dark red, brown, or violaceous lesions of the skin or mucous membranes; human herpes virus type 8 can also cause primary effusion lymphoma and Castleman disease (giant lymph node hyperplasia). Human papillomavirus–related malignancies are significantly increased in HIV, including cervical and anal cancers, and regular guideline-based screening is important.</p>
