<article><h1>04 Dermatology</h1>
<p>Cutaneous fungal infections are typically characteristic for specific areas of the body and are frequently associated with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warm or moist environments</strong></li>
<li>**Diabetes mellitus **</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Recent antibiotic use</li>
</ul>
<p>Tinea versicolor, also known as pityriasis versicolor, is a cutaneous fungal infection caused by yeasts in the genus <strong><em>Malassezia</em></strong> (formerly known as <em>Pityrosporum</em>). It is most commonly caused by <em>Malassezia globosa.</em></p>
<p><em>Malessezia</em>, the causative genus of tinea versicolor, is a dimorphic fungus that is part of the <strong>normal skin flora and is not contagious</strong>.</p>
<p>Pathologic tinea versicolor is most common in the <strong>summer</strong> due to hot, humid weather.</p>
<p>Additional risk factors include the use of <strong>topical skin oils</strong> and <strong>hyperhidrosis</strong> (excessive sweating).</p>
<p>Patients with <strong>tinea versicolor</strong> classically present with hypopigmented lesions that fail to tan despite summer sun exposure.</p>
<p>Tinea versicolor presents with <strong>hypopigmented, hyperpigmented, or salmon-colored macules on the trunk and proximal upper extremities</strong> from the degradation of lipids that produces acids that damage melanocytes.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of tinea versicolor is made with a <strong>potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation</strong>. Both hyphae and yeast cells are evident in a pattern that is described as “<strong>spaghetti and meatballs</strong>.”</p>
<p>First-line treatments for tinea versicolor include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selenium sulfide</strong></li>
<li><strong>Zinc pyrithione</strong></li>
<li><strong>Topical antifungals</strong> (e.g. ketoconazole 2% cream)</li>
</ul>
<p>Dermatophyte (non-<em>Malassezia</em> tinea) infections, also known as ringworm, are cutaneous fungal infections caused by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Epidermophyton</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Trichophyton</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Microsporum</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Lesions are <strong>pruritic</strong>, <strong>erythematous</strong>, <strong>scaly plaques</strong> that have a characteristic <strong>central clearing</strong>. This gives the lesion the appearance that a ring surrounds it.</p>
<p>Dermatophyte infections are named based on the location of the lesion as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Head, scalp: tinea <strong>capitis</strong></li>
<li>Torso: tinea <strong>corporis</strong></li>
<li>Groin: tinea <strong>cruris</strong></li>
<li>Feet: tinea <strong>pedis</strong></li>
<li>Nail bed: tinea <strong>unguium</strong>(onychomycosis)</li>
</ul>
<p>The diagnosis can be made with a <strong>potassium hydroxide preparation</strong>, which shows <strong>hyphae</strong>.</p>
<p>Treatment consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Topical antifungal</strong> medication for multiple weeks with <strong>oral antifungal</strong> in resistant cases</li>
<li><strong>Oral griseofulvin or terbinafine</strong>for tinea capitis</li>
<li><strong>Oral terbinafine</strong> for onychomycosis</li>
</ul>
<p>Intertrigo is as an inflammatory condition of skin folds (intertriginous areas). It is most commonly caused by <strong><em>Candida albicans</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Lesions are <strong>pruritic</strong>, <strong>painful</strong>, <strong>erythematous plaques most commonly found in skin creases</strong>.</p>
<p>The diagnosis can be made with a <strong>potassium hydroxide preparation</strong>, which shows budding yeasts with septate hyphae and pseudohyphae.</p>
<p>Treatment consists of <strong>topical antifungal</strong> medication and <strong>topical corticosteroids</strong>.</p>
<h1>Hypersensitivity Skin</h1>
<p><strong>Hypersensitivity reactions</strong> in skin refers to allergic reactions in skin because of either <strong>cutaneous contact</strong> or <strong>ingestion</strong> of a given allergen.</p>
<p>Common causes of hypersensitivity skin reactions that should be remembered include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plants (poison ivy, poison oak)</li>
<li>Nickel</li>
<li>Soaps</li>
<li>Latex</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Type I</strong> hypersensitivity skin reactions are caused by mast cell degranulation.</p>
<p>Type I reactions result in a<strong>light, diffuse rash</strong> that appears <strong>soon after exposure</strong> and lasts several hours.</p>
<p><strong>Type IV</strong> hypersensitivity skin reactions are caused by lymphocyte activity. This is the mechanism of most allergic contact dermatitis.</p>
<p>Type IV reactions appear <strong>similarly to a measles rash</strong>(small red spots that are slightly raised and appear in clusters) and appear <strong>several days after the second exposure</strong> to an allergen.</p>
<p>The clinical presentation of a hypersensitivity reaction gives clues to the cause:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact dermatitis</strong> causes a pruritic, erythematous rash in <strong>distinct patterns</strong>, such as <strong>lines or shapes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Food or drug reactions</strong> can cause a rash in a specific location or in a <strong>poorly defined</strong> area.</li>
<li>Obtaining the contact and ingestion history from the patient is helpful for diagnosis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary treatment is to stop the offending agent or to prevent contact with the suspected allergen.</p>
<p>Topical corticosteroids and antihistamines can provide relief for mild cases, but more severe cases may require oral corticosteroids.</p>
<h1>Psoriasis</h1>
<p>Psoriasis is a complex autoimmune inflammatory skin disease caused by a<strong>dysregulation of the immune system to the skin</strong>, leading to a <strong>hyperproliferation of the epidermis</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental (cold exposure, infection, medications), genetic, and immunologic (T-cell overactivity)</strong> factors seem to play a role in psoriasis.</p>
<p>Patients typically present with <strong>worsening erythematous scaling skin most often affecting the extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees</strong>.</p>
<p>Patients may also present with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Joint pain</strong></li>
<li><strong>J oint swelling</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pruritus</strong></li>
<li><strong>Conjunctivitis</strong></li>
<li><strong>Conjunctival dryness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The diagnosis of psoriasis is based on <strong>clinical findings of the physical exam</strong>. Skin biopsy can be used to help rule in the diagnosis when a patient presents with non-classical skin symptoms such as pustules**.**</p>
<p>On physical exam, the patient’s skin lesions are typically erythematous plaques. The classic lesion is a <strong>salmon colored patch on the extensor portions of the elbows and knees</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Uric acid</strong> levels may be elevated in some forms of psoriasis, confusing it with gout. ESR is typically normal, but can be elevated in other forms such as erythrodermic and pustular psoriasis.</p>
<p>Psoriasis may result in the following complications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondary bacterial infections</li>
<li>Psoriatic arthritis</li>
<li>Chronic conjunctivitis</li>
<li>Blepharitis</li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment of psoriasis is primarily dependent on severity of skin lesions and responsiveness to treatment. Management of mild-to-moderate psoriasis consists of either:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Topical corticosteroids (initially)</strong></li>
<li>Topical retinoids (tazarotene)</li>
<li>Topical vitamin D</li>
<li>Anthralin</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phototherapy, or methotrexate</strong>in patients that have failed phototherapy, is the mainstay therapy in moderate to severe psoriasis, while <strong>cyclosporine</strong> can be used intermittently to help induce a therapeutic response.</p>
<p><strong>Topical corticosteroids</strong> are used when ocular lesions are present.</p>
<h1>Scabies</h1>
<p>Scabies is a <strong>cutaneous infestation by the mite <em>Sarcoptes scabiei</em></strong> that causes an intense pruritic lesion with characteristic distribution.</p>
<p>Risk factors for acquiring scabies include <strong>crowded living conditions and poor hygiene</strong>.</p>
<p>Scabies is transmitted person to person by <strong>direct physical contact</strong>.</p>
<p>Patients with a scabies infestation will present with <strong>very intense pruritus</strong> at the sites involved, which becomes <strong>worse at night and worsens after a hot bath</strong>.</p>
<p>The most common locations for scabies are the <strong>webs of fingers and toes</strong>, and mite burrows with nearby papules can be seen under the skin.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of scabies is <strong>usually clinical on the basis of history and the characteristic distribution of the skin lesions</strong>. For a more definitive diagnosis, <strong>skin scrapings can be viewed under a microscope to reveal mites and eggs</strong>.</p>
<p>The main complication of a scabies infestation is the <strong>spread of the infestation to close contacts</strong>, which is common.</p>
<p>Scabies can be treated with either <strong>topical permethrin 5% cream</strong> or <strong>oral ivermectin</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Diphenhydramine</strong> may be used to relieve the pruritus associated with scabies.</p>
<p>Once treatment is initiated, <strong>all clothing, bedding, towels, and linens must be washed in hot water</strong> to prevent reinfestation.</p>
<h1>Seborrheic Dermatitis</h1>
<p><strong>Seborrheic dermatitis</strong> is an<strong>idiopathic form of dermatitis that commonly affects sebum-rich areas of the body</strong> (scalp, face) resulting in dry, flaky skin.</p>
<p>Seborrheic dermatitis most commonly occurs in <strong>healthy infants and adults</strong>, but <strong>has also been associated with other disorders such as HIV and Parkinson’s disease</strong>.</p>
<p>Patients with seborrheic dermatitis classically present with <strong>intermittent episodes of burning, scaling, and itching skin</strong>. Symptoms tend to worsen during the dry winter months.</p>
<p>&quot;Cradle cap&quot; is a term commonly used for infantile seborrheic dermatitis that causes <strong>scaly patches on the infants scalp</strong>.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis is <strong>based primarily on clinical presentation</strong>. <strong>Skin biopsy can be performed to help rule out other skin disorders</strong>.</p>
<p>One of the most common physical exam findings is <strong>a dry flaking scalp</strong>. Other common findings are <strong>pruritus, erythematous plaques, and yellowish crusting of the skin</strong>.</p>
<p>Seborrheic dermatitis may result in <strong>hypopigmentation, scarring and secondary bacterial infection</strong>.</p>
<p>Treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the <strong>scalp consists of antifungal shampoo (e.g. ketoconazole, selenium sulfite)</strong> while <strong>other areas of the body are treated with topical corticosteroids, topical antifungals, or both</strong>.</p>
<h1>Stevens Johnson</h1>
<p>**Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)**is a <strong>severe form of erythema multiforme involving mucous membranes and severe plaque formation</strong>. It is an immune-mediated hypersensitivity reaction that leads to necrosis and sloughing of the epidermis.</p>
<p>Stevens-Johnson syndrome represents the same process as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Involvement of &lt;10% of the body surface is diagnosed as SJS</strong></li>
<li><strong>Involvement of &gt;30% is diagnosed as TEN</strong></li>
<li>Involvement in between is diagnosed as SJS/TEN</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 4 etiologic categories for SJS:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medications (most common)</strong> (e.g. penicillin, sulfa containing drugs, NSAIDs, allopurinol, phenytoin, and carbamazepine)</li>
<li>Infections (HIV, hepatitis)</li>
<li>Malignancy</li>
<li>Idiopathic</li>
</ul>
<p>SJS presents with a <strong>2-3 day prodromal period of fever and flu-like symptoms prior to the development of mucocutaneous lesions</strong>. After the prodromal period, a palpable macular rash will begin to appear, and then fluid filled blisters and ultimately sloughing of the skin.</p>
<p>In a patient’s first drug-exposure related case of SJS, the drug exposure typically occurs <strong>one to three weeks before the development of symptoms</strong>. The time course from prodrome until hospital discharge ranges between two to four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Blistering and swelling</strong> of the oral cavity is also seen in patients with SJS.</p>
<p><strong>Conjunctival and corneal lesions</strong> are more serious complications that can lead to permanent blindess.</p>
<p>There are no specific diagnostic studies for SJS, but a history suggestive of drug exposure/illness, positive clinical symptoms, and a <strong>skin biopsy can help confirm clinical suspicion</strong>.</p>
<p>On physical examination a patient with SJS will typically have an erythematous rash which may have the appearance of a target. Other signs that raise concern of SJS include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Palpable rash</li>
<li>Blisters</li>
<li>Skin sloughing</li>
<li>Tongue swelling</li>
<li>Oral and lip ulcerations</li>
<li>Conjunctivitis and corneal ulcerations</li>
</ul>
<p>Lesions typically <strong>start on the face and thorax</strong> before spreading, and spare the scalp.</p>
<p>After a few days, vesicles and bullae form, and the skin begins to slough.<strong>Nikolsky sign</strong> (<strong>gentle lateral pressure on skin surface on an apparently uninvolved site which causes sloughing</strong>) may be positive.</p>
<p><strong>Mucous membranes are almost always involved in SJS</strong>, including the oral mucosa (including tongue), conjunctiva, urethra, and pulmonary mucosa. Patients present with crusting and ulceration of the mucosal surface.</p>
<p>Skin biopsies are fairly specific and typically show <strong>lymphocytes within perivascular structures and full thickness epidermal detachment with a normal immunofluorescence</strong>. There will also be degeneration of the basal layer of the epidermis.</p>
<p>The mortality rate of SJS is <strong>about 10%</strong>. In those who survive, SJS can result in complications involving the skin, eyes, mouth, GU system, and lungs.</p>
<p>An early SJS complication is <strong>secondary bacterial infection</strong>.</p>
<p>Later dermatologic sequelae include <strong>irregular pigmentation, eruptive nevi, abnormal regrowth of nails, and alopecia</strong>.</p>
<p>Ophthalmologic complications include <strong>dry eye, photophobia, visual impairment, and corneal scarring that can lead to blindness</strong>. It is imperative to obtain an ophthalmology consultation in a patient with SJS to prevent ocular damage.</p>
<p>Genitourinary complications in women include <strong>labial and vaginal abnormalities and urinary retention</strong>.</p>
<p>Long-term pulmonary complications include <strong>chronic bronchitis/bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis, and obstructive disorders</strong>.</p>
<p>Because the most common cause of SJS is a reaction to medication, the most important first step in treatment is to <strong>stop the offending medication</strong>.</p>
<p>SJS is frequently treated <strong>in burn units or intensive care units with corticosteroids, analgesics, and intravenous fluids</strong>.</p>
<p>Ocular lesions are typically treated with <strong>moisturizing drops, topical antibiotics, and topical steroids</strong>.</p>
<h1>TEN</h1>
<p><strong>Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)</strong> is the most severe form of hypersensitivity reaction involving the mucous membranes and skin, leading to <strong>full thickness epidermal necrosis and sloughing of &gt;30%</strong> of the body surface area.</p>
<p>TEN is <strong>most commonly caused by medications</strong>, but <strong>can also be caused by an infection or be idiopathic</strong>.</p>
<p>Medications that are known can contribute to the development of TEN include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NSAIDs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Antibiotics</strong>(sulfonamides, penicillin, quinolones)</li>
<li><strong>Allopurinol</strong></li>
<li><strong>Anticonvulsants</strong></li>
<li><strong>Antiretrovirals</strong>(nevirapine, abacavir)</li>
</ul>
<p>TEN typically presents with <strong>fever and flu-like symptoms 1-3 days before the development of skin lesions</strong>, which begin on the face and thorax before spreading to other areas of the body.</p>
<p>The skin lesions <strong>begin as an erythematous maculopapular rash</strong> which <strong>progresses to large painful blisters and ultimately sloughing</strong>.</p>
<p>Mucosal eruptions occur in up to 90% of patients, with <strong>oral mucosa almost always being involved</strong>. Ocular involvement can lead to conjunctival and corneal lesions that can lead to permanent scarring and blindness.</p>
<p>TEN is a <strong>clinical diagnosis</strong> based on findings such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skin lesions that are sensitive to touch and tend to slough off in large sheets with light touch (known as a positive Nikolsky’s sign)</li>
<li>Blistering and ulcerations seen on the lips and oral mucosa</li>
<li>Ocular involvement showing conjunctival redness and irritation</li>
</ul>
<p>Laboratory findings associated with toxic epidermal necrolysis include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decreased WBCs</li>
<li>Decreased hemoglobin</li>
<li>Decreased hematocrit</li>
<li>Increased ALT and AST</li>
</ul>
<p>Because TEN is most commonly caused by medications, the most important first step in management is to <strong>stop the offending agent</strong>.</p>
<p>Patients with TEN should be treated <strong>in a burn unit with intravenous hydration, corticosteroids, and intravenous immune globulin</strong>.</p>
<p>Ocular lesions are typically treated with <strong>moisturizing drops, topical antibiotics, and topical steroids</strong>.</p>
<p>Cases of TEN that are caused by HSV may benefit from the use of <strong>acyclovir</strong>.</p>
<p>Complications associated with TEN include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Severe dehydration</li>
<li>Malnutrition</li>
<li>Secondary bacterial infection</li>
<li>Pneumonia</li>
<li>Strictures and scarring</li>
<li>Corneal ulceration, scarring, and even blindness.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mortality rate of TEN is <strong>over 30%</strong>.</p>
