<!-- Triphasic waves EEG -->
<ul>
<li>hepatic encephalopathy EEG</li>
<li>creutzfeldt jakob.,</li>
</ul>
<!-- diffuse slowing of background -->
<ul>
<li>diffuse encephalopathies of diverse causes.,</li>
</ul>
<!-- Periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges -->
<ul>
<li>presence of an acute destructive cerebral lesion and are associated with focal neurological findings of <strong>stroke</strong>.,</li>
</ul>
<!-- decreased alpha activity and increased voltage of theta and delta waves -->
<ul>
<li>opioid toxicity.,</li>
</ul>
<!-- marijuana intoxication ekg -->
<ul>
<li>This drug increased alpha activity in the frontal area of the brain, but <strong>overall slows alpha activity</strong>.,</li>
</ul>
<!--  caffeine withdrawal -->
<ul>
<li>There is an <strong>increase</strong> in amplitude or voltage of <strong>theta</strong> activity on EEG with this condition.,</li>
</ul>
<!--  nicotine withdrawal -->
<ul>
<li>There is a marked <strong>decrease in alpha</strong> activity seen on the EEG during the withdrawal period.,</li>
</ul>
<!-- barbiturate withdrawal -->
<p>In withdrawal states, EEG shows <strong>generalized paroxysmal activity and spike discharges</strong>.,</p>
<h2>Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</h2>
<!-- temporal lobe epilepsy symptoms -->
<ul>
<li>characterized by hyposexuality, emotional intensity, and viscosity, a peculiar perseverative approach to interactions with others.,</li>
</ul>
<p>case:  A 25-year-old woman is seen by a psychiatrist because her family says that she is “hyperintense” about everything. On interview the patient denies mood swings, though does note that she is “emotionally intense.” She denies hallucinations, delusions, suicidal or homicidal ideation. She is noted to be very “perseverative” in her interaction with the psychiatrist, pursuing even small points of discussion further and further so that very little ground can be covered during the interview.</p>
<h2>Memories</h2>
<!-- different types of memories and locations in brain.. -->
<ul>
<li>Episodic memory: memories of events. Is sited in the <strong>medial temporal lobes, the anterior thalamic nucleus, mamillary body, fornix, and prefrontal cortex.</strong></li>
<li>Semantic memory: memories of common knowledge. is located in the <strong>inferolateral temporal lobes</strong> and is responsible for allowing patients to correctly answer such questions as the <strong>color of a certain breed of dog, or how an orange and an apple are different.</strong></li>
<li>Procedural memory: memories of motor skills. Allows one to remember how to drive a car. Such memory is located in the <strong>basal ganglia, cerebellum, and supplementary motor area</strong>.</li>
<li>Working memory is the ability to store information for several seconds while other cognitive activities work on the information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lobes of brain</h2>
<!-- lobes of brian function.. -->
<ul>
<li>The temporal lobe contains the auditory cortex, and is also involved in the formation of long-term memories.</li>
<li>The limbic system is a complicated, multi-functional area of the brain responsible for the control of emotions, olfaction, long-term memory, and behavior.</li>
<li>The basal ganglion are also multi-functional, involved in the control of emotions, procedural movements of routine behaviors, and voluntary movements.</li>
</ul>
