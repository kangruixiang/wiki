<p>A pap smear is a screening test for cervical dysplasia where <strong>cells that are scraped from the transition zone</strong> (where squamous and columnar epithelium meet at the opening of the cervix) are examined under microscope. Page 2 of the following link provides the USPTF guidelines for cervical cancer screening.</p>
<p>Cellular grading of <strong>cervical dysplasia</strong> is done based on the histological pap smear findings, using the following grading system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS)</li>
<li>Atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H)</li>
<li>Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL)</li>
<li>High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL)</li>
</ul>
<h2>ASCH</h2>
<p><strong>Atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H)</strong> characterizes cellular abnormalities in the cervical epithelium that likely consist of a mixture of true high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and other findings that mimic such lesions.</p>
<p>Patients with a pap smear showing ASC-H should undergo immediate <strong>colposcopy</strong>.</p>
<h2>LSIL</h2>
<p>Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) characterizes <strong>mild cellular dysplasia in the cervical epithelium</strong>.</p>
<p>LSIL in a patient who is** 25 years old** or older and HPV negative should be <strong>followed-up in 1 year with cytology and HPV co-testing</strong> to determine whether cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is present. If co-testing is both negative, co-testing should be done again in 3 years.</p>
<p>LSIL in a patient who is 25 years old or older and HPV positive (or has an unknown HPV status) should be investigated with <strong>colposcopy</strong>. The presence or absence of CIN2,3 will dictate management based on ASCCP guidelines.</p>
<p>LSIL in a patient who between 21 and 24 years of age should be <strong>followed-up in 12 months with repeat cytology</strong>. If negative, repeat again in 12 months and if repeat cytology is negative, the patient may return to routine screening. If cytology shows ASC-US or worse, colposcopy should be conducted.</p>
<h2>HSIL</h2>
<p>High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) describes a pap smear finding of <strong>moderate or severe cellular dysplasia in the cervical epithelium</strong>. Because this is a scraping, it is impossible to determine whether this represents partial-thickness atypia, full-thickness atypia (carcinoma in situ), or carcinoma.</p>
<p>HSIL on a pap smear should be followed-up with colposcopy (including biopsies if indicated) to determine whether cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is present.</p>
<h2>ASCUS</h2>
<p>Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) characterizes <strong>cellular abnormalities in the cervical epithelium that are not explained by reactive changes and are not diagnostic of intraepithelial lesions.</strong></p>
<p>According to the 2014 ASCCP guidelines, treatment of ASCUS (HPV unknown) involves one of the following treatment options:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Repeat pap in 12 months</strong></li>
<li><strong>HPV testing at the time of ASCUS diagnosis</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A patient with an ASCUS pap who is HPV negative should undergo <strong>repeat cytology and HPV co-testing in 3 years</strong>.</p>
<p>A patient with an ASCUS pap who is HPV positive should undergo <strong>colposcopy.</strong></p>
<p>If a patient with an ASCUS pap has an unknown HPV status and cannot be tested for HPV, <strong>repeat the pap smear in 12 months</strong>. <strong>If her repeat pap at 12 months is also ASCUS (or worse), then the appropriate treatment is colposcopy.</strong></p>
<p>Women age 21-24 with ASCUS or LSIL should undergo **repeat pap in 1 year. **Reflex HPV testing is not indicated in this population, and colposcopy is only indicated if the lesion advances beyond LSIL.</p>
<p>Note: Women age &lt;21 should not undergo pap smear regardless of whether they are sexually active, due to the increased prevalence of transitory, clinically insignificant cervical dysplasia in this population and the long-term harm caused by treatment of these clinically insignificant findings.</p>
<h1>Colposcopy</h1>
<p>Colposcopy is a diagnostic procedure where a dissecting microscope (colposcope) is used to obtain an illuminated and magnified view of the cervix for biopsy.</p>
<p>Acetic acid is used to improve visualization of abnormal areas as the solution causes metaplastic cells to reflect light and appear white, referred to as “<strong>acetowhite</strong>” changes.</p>
<p>In order to best detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, <strong>multiple biopsies</strong> are taken.</p>
<p>Colposcopic biopsy results are graded using a different system from pap smears:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-1</strong> (CIN-1)</li>
<li><strong>Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-2</strong>or<strong>3</strong> (CIN-2 or 3)</li>
<li>**Invasive carcinoma **</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-1 (CIN-1)</strong> is considered low-grade dysplasia found after colposcopy and describes dysplasia within the lower third of the cervical epithelium (farthest from the epithelial surface).</p>
<p>Treatment of CIN-1 <strong>varies by patient age and Pap smear findings prior to colposcopy.</strong></p>
<p>It may include anything from repeat colposcopy every 6 months for two years (for patients age 21-24 with HSIL Pap prior to colposcopy) to repeat Pap with HPV co-testing in 12 months and again in 3 years if normal (for patients at least 25 years old with ASCUS or LSIL Pap prior to colposcopy). This algorithm is complex and unlikely to be tested on USMLE.</p>
<p><strong>Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-2 and 3 (CIN-2 and 3)</strong> is considered high-grade dysplasia found after colposcopy and describes dysplasia within the lower two-thirds of the cervical epithelium farthest from the epithelial surface (CIN-2), up to full thickness atypia (CIN-3).</p>
<p>Treatment of CIN-2 or 3 involves excision by loop electrocautery excision procedure (LEEP) or conization or laser ablation, with co-testing (cytology and endocervical curettage) at 12 and 24 months. However, co-testing should be repeated earlier (at 4-6 months) if CIN2,3 is identified at the margins. If negative for two visits, repeat three years later.</p>
<p>Squamous cell carcinoma refers to <strong>highly atypical cells with stromal invasion</strong>. For treatment see the cervical cancer topic.</p>
