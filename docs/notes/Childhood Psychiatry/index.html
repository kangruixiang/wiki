<article><h1>Childhood Psychiatry</h1>
<!-- autism symptoms, buzzwords.. -->
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impaired social interaction (reduced empathy, <strong>reduced interest in socialization</strong>)</li>
<li>Impaired communication (<strong>inability to understand social cues</strong> and nonverbal messages)</li>
<li>Repetitive/stereotyped patterns of behavior (fixated interests, <strong>inflexibility to change</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>According to DSM-5, ASD symptoms must be present by &quot;early development&quot; (previous DSM-IV timeframe was age 3).</p>
<p>Some key buzzwords and phrases in recognizing <strong>autism spectrum disorder</strong> in a question stem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does not play with other children</li>
<li>Has a notebook filled with drawings of the same object</li>
<li>Speaks in a monotone or &quot;professorial&quot; style</li>
</ul>
<!-- autism rule outs.. -->
<p>Before making diagnosis of autism based on poor language/social skills, order a hearing test to <strong>rule out deafness</strong>.</p>
<!-- autism NT changes -->
<p>Individuals smay have <strong>increased serotonin</strong> levels.,</p>
<!-- autism neuroanatomy -->
<p>Neuroanatomical findings include <strong>increased cortical thickness</strong> and <strong>increased total brain volume</strong>.,</p>
<!-- autism treatment.. -->
<p>Treatment may involve <strong>remedial education and behavioral therapy</strong>.</p>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>Prognosis is best determined by <strong>language development</strong>.</p>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>In DSM-5, the following disorders were removed and instead made to fit under the umbrella of <strong>autism spectrum disorder</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Autistic Disorder</li>
<li>Asperger's Disorder</li>
<li>Childhood Disintegrative Disorder</li>
<li>Pervasive Developmental Disorder NOS</li>
</ul>
<p>Patients who were previously diagnosed with these disorders fit the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder and receive the new diagnosis.</p>
<!-- rett syndrome age, pt, symptoms, mutation.. -->
<p>Rett syndrome is an X-linked disorder marked by <strong>regression</strong> in physical and psychomotor development <strong>after around 6 months of normal development</strong>. This is an important distinguishing factor when compared to autism spectrum disorder.</p>
<p>Rett syndrome is <strong>predominantly seen in girls</strong>, since affected males die in utero.</p>
<p>The classic description of Rett syndrome is <strong>stereotyped hand-wringing</strong> movements.</p>
<p>Associated with the <strong>de novo</strong> mutations of the <strong>MECP2 gene</strong> on the X chromosome.</p>
<h1>ADHD</h1>
<!-- ADHD symptoms, association.. -->
<p>**Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) **is characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inattention: problems with listening, concentrating, paying attention to details, organizing tasks, easily distracted, or often forgetful</li>
<li>Hyperactivity: blurting out answers, interrupting, fidgeting, and talking excessively</li>
</ul>
<p>The symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity must be observed in multiple settings such as at home, in school, etc. and before the age of 12 years.</p>
<p>Two thirds of children with ADHD also have <strong>conduct disorder</strong> or <strong>oppositional defiant disorder.</strong></p>
<!-- ADHD similar disease.. -->
<p><strong>Lead toxicity</strong> may produce symptoms similar to ADHD. Consider it in the differential if a patient has risk factors (e.g. living in an old house with chipping paint, using foreign pottery, etc.)</p>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>1st line treatment for ADHD is <strong>CNS stimulants</strong> (methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, amphetamine salts). <strong>Atomoxetine</strong> is a non-stimulant that can be used if the patient cannot tolerate stimulants.</p>
<!-- amphetamine stimulants se.. -->
<p>Amphetamine stimulants may have the following side effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insomnia</strong></li>
<li><strong>Anxiety</strong></li>
<li><strong>Decreased appetite</strong></li>
<li><strong>Secondary hypertension</strong></li>
<li>**Poor growth **(growth should be regularly monitored)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Watching for the development of these side effects is important when starting a patient on these medications.</em></p>
<h1>MDDD</h1>
<!-- MDDD symptoms, treatment -->
<p>Characterized by <strong>severe, recurrent temper outbursts</strong> that are inconsistent with the situation and the child’s developmental level. Outbursts can be <strong>verbal rages</strong> or <strong>acts of physical aggression</strong> that occur at least three times per week for at least 12 months. <strong>In between outbursts, the patient is persistently irritable.</strong> The diagnosis must be made between the ages of 6 and 18. Initial treatment generally involves psychotherapy such as <strong>cognitive behavioral therapy</strong>. If nonpharmacological treatments fail to improve symptoms, <strong>stimulants, antipsychotics, and antidepressants</strong> are the most effective medications for the treatment. <strong>Methylphenidate</strong> is a stimulant that decreases irritability in children.,</p>
<h1>Other Disorders</h1>
<h2>Separation Anxiety</h2>
<!-- separation anxiety disorder vs physiological separation anxiety. Symptoms.. -->
<p>Separation anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive anxiety concerning separation from home or from those to whom the individual is attached. The anxiety is persistent and lasts ≥4 weeks in children and adolescents and ≥6 months in adults. It most commonly occurs at age 7-8 <strong>after a stressful life event</strong> (e.g. divorce, birth of a sibling, changing schools, etc.).</p>
<p>When forced to separate, children with separation anxiety disorder avoid separation by <strong>feigning physical complaints.</strong></p>
<p>The differential of separation anxiety disorder includes <strong>physiological separation anxiety</strong>. Children are expected to stop experiencing separation anxiety around <em>age 2-3.</em></p>
<!-- separation anxiety treatment, complications.. -->
<p>Treatment of separation anxiety disorder includes <strong>CBT</strong> and <strong>SSRI 's</strong>.</p>
<p>Separation anxiety disorder is a risk factor for the development of <strong>MDD</strong> and <strong>panic disorder</strong> as an adult.</p>
<h2>Selective Mutism</h2>
<!-- selective mutism is, symptoms, treatment.. -->
<p>Selective mutism is characterized by refusal to speak in certain situations for at least 1 month, despite the presence of normal language ability. The classic presentation is a child with <strong>minimal verbal interaction at school</strong>, <strong>but whose parents notice no problems at home</strong>.</p>
<p>The treatment of selective mutism involves <strong>psychotherapy</strong>, <strong>behavior therapy</strong>, and <strong>management of anxiety</strong>.</p>
<h2>Imaginary friends</h2>
<!-- imaginary friends for kids age.. -->
<p>It is normal for children to have imaginary friends from <strong>ages 2-6</strong>. In the absence of other concerning signs (e.g. violent command hallucinations, genital trauma, etc.), do not be fooled by question stems into thinking this behavior is indicative of psychosis, abuse, or other pathology.</p>
<h1>Enuresis</h1>
<!-- enuresis is, time, diagnosis.. -->
<p>Enuresis is involuntary voiding of urine (bed-wetting) in children <strong>≥5 years of age</strong>.</p>
<p>To diagnose enuresis, urinary problems must occur <strong>2x/week</strong> for <strong>3 months</strong>.</p>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>First line pharmacologic interventions include <strong>desmopressin</strong> and behavioral modification with enuresis alarms. Tricyclic antidepressants, most commonly imipramine, are a second-line treatment.</p>
<p>Organic causes of enuresis, such as <strong>UTI, diabetes, or seizures</strong> should be ruled out.</p>
<h1>Encopresis</h1>
<!-- Encopresis diagnosis.. -->
<p>Encopresis is involuntary or intentional passage of feces in inappropriate places by children <strong>≥4 years of age</strong>.</p>
<p>To diagnose encopresis, involuntary stool passage must occur at least <strong>1x/month</strong> for at least <strong>3 months</strong>.</p>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>Treatment involves <strong>psychotherapy.</strong> Address constipation if it is contributing to etiology.</p>
<p>Rule out organic causes of abnormal defecation before diagnosing encopresis, such as <strong>constipation, hypothyroidism, and anal fissures</strong>.</p>
<h1>Infant Deprivation and Childhood Regression</h1>
<!-- childhood regression happens when.. -->
<p>Children can regress to younger behavior under conditions including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Punishment</li>
<li>Physical illness</li>
<li>Birth of a new sibling</li>
<li>Divorce</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: A toilet-trained child suddenly experiencing encopresis or enuresis after her parents get a divorce.</p>
<!-- infant affection deprivation result.. -->
<p>Long term deprivation of affection in infants results in crying or <strong>W</strong>ah, <strong>W</strong>ah, <strong>W</strong>ah, <strong>W</strong>ah</p>
<p>The 4 <strong>W</strong>’s:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>W</strong>eak → decreased muscle tone, weight loss, and physical illness</li>
<li><strong>W</strong>ordless → poor language skills and anaclitic depression</li>
<li><strong>W</strong>anting → poor socialization skills</li>
<li><strong>W</strong>ary → lack of basic trust</li>
</ul>
<p>Deprivation for <strong>&gt;6 months</strong> can lead to irreversible changes or even death.</p>
<h2>Anaclitic depression</h2>
<!-- what is anaclitic depression, aka -->
<p>Hospitalism is depression in an infant attributable to continued separation from a caregiver resulting in withdrawn and unresponsive infants.,</p>
<h2>Disinhibited social engagement disorder</h2>
<!-- disinhibited social engagement disorder is, vs reactive attachment disorder, causes.. -->
<p><strong>Disinhibited social engagement disorder</strong> presents as a young child (&gt;9 months) who is overly familiar with and interactive with unfamiliar adults.</p>
<p>Additionally, these patients feel n<strong>o need to check in with their adult caregiver,</strong> even in unfamiliar settings. <strong>No separation anxiety.</strong></p>
<p>In contrast, reactive attachment disorder presents as a young child who is emotionally withdrawn and with a flat affect when with caregivers. Both of these “pathological relationship” childhood disorders are seen in patients with a history of <strong>social neglect/deprivation.</strong></p>
<h1>Intellectual Disability</h1>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>Intellectual Disability is a disorder of cognitive, social, and practical functioning. Patients are deficient in multiple domains of everyday living. <strong>Specific learning disorders</strong> must be evaluated when working up this disorder, as an apparent deficit in functioning may be most accurately due to a learning disorder, intellectual disability, or both (learning disorders may be co-morbid with intellectual disability and may be concurrently diagnosed).</p>
<!-- intellectual disability diagnosis criteria.. -->
<p>In order to diagnose intellectual disability, three criteria must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intellectual</strong> deficits (verified by standardized testing)</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive functioning</strong> deficits (activities of daily life, social communication, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Onset</strong> during developmental period</li>
</ul>
<p>Severity of intellectual disability is <em>no longer determined by IQ ranges</em>, as of the DSM-5. Instead, the qualifiers of mild, moderate, or severe intellectual disability are determined by <strong>adaptive functioning deficits</strong>.</p>
<h2>Learning Disorder</h2>
<!-- learning disorder is, most common, rule out.. -->
<p>Learning disorders refer to achievement in reading, math, or writing that is significantly lower than expected age and intelligence. <strong>Reading disorder</strong> is the most common learning disorder.</p>
<p><strong>Sensory deficits</strong> should be ruled out prior to diagnosing learning disorder.</p>
<!-- learning disorder causes, chromosomal, preventable, inherited.. -->
<p>Around 50% of cases of intellectual disability are <strong>idiopathic</strong>. Defined causes of intellectual disability range from genetic, prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal.</p>
<p>The most common chromosomal cause of intellectual disability is <strong>Down syndrome.</strong></p>
<p>The most common preventable cause of intellectual disability is <strong>fetal alcohol syndrome</strong>.</p>
<p>The most common inherited form of intellectual disability is <strong>fragile X syndrome.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prader-Willi syndrome</strong> is a cause of intellectual disability, with characteristic physical appearances. Suspect this disorder in a patient with obesity, hypogonadism, and almond-shaped eyes.</p>
<p>Prader-Willi syndrome can be caused by either:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sporadic deletion of paternal 15q11.2-13</strong> (65-75% of cases)</li>
<li>**Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 **(20-30% of cases)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Tourette</h1>
<!-- tourette disorder diagnosis.. -->
<p>Tourette’s disorder is a disorder characterized by both motor and vocal tics. In order to diagnose Tourette's disorder, there must be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple motor tic events</strong></li>
<li><strong>One or more vocal/phonic tic events</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tics must be present for &gt;1 year</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tics must take place multiple times a day and/or nearly every day</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Tics must be present for <strong>&gt;1 year</strong> to diagnose Tourette's disorder.</p>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>Types of vocal tics include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Coprolalia</em>: <strong>Repetition of curse words</strong> (uncommon)</li>
<li><em>Echolalia</em>: <strong>Repetition of words made by another person</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Tourette's disorder shares a genetic relationship to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder <strong>(ADHD)</strong> and obsessive-compulsive disorder <strong>(OCD)</strong>.</p>
<!-- tourette neuroanatomy changes -->
<p>Neuroanatomical findings include <strong>caudate nucleus atrophy</strong> and <strong>decreased frontal lobe mass</strong>.,</p>
<h2>PANDAS</h2>
<!-- PANDAS are, symptoms.. -->
<p>Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections <strong>(PANDAS)</strong> is group of tic and obsessive-compulsive disorders linked to Group A streptococcal infection and subsequent autoimmune damage. Classically, a patient would present with <strong>tics that are worse in winter and spring.</strong></p>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<!-- tourette management.. -->
<p>Two 1st line treatments of Tourette's disorder are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>α2 agonists</strong> (e.g. clonidine, guanfacine)</li>
<li><strong>A ntipsychotics</strong> (e.g. haloperidol, risperidone)</li>
</ul>
<p>α2 agonists are often tried first due to the side effects and morbidities of antipsychotics.</p>
<p><strong>Stimulants</strong> used to treat ADHD may exacerbate comorbid Tourette's disorder. However, <strong>atomoxetine</strong> is a non-stimulant that does not exacerbate tics.</p>
<p><em>Note: While this relationship has been contested in recent studies, it is still an important concept to be aware of.</em></p>
