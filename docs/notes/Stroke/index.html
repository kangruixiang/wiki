<h1>Aphasia</h1>
<h2>Broca's</h2>
<!-- Broca's aphasia aka.. -->
<p>Broca’s aphasia is an <strong>expressive aphasia</strong>, which is a loss of the ability to produce language.</p>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>Broca aphasia results from damage to Broca’s area (language motor area), which includes the following areas of the dominant hemisphere:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inferior frontal gyrus</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dorsolateral frontal cortex</strong></li>
<li><strong>Anterior parietal cortex</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Patients with <strong>Broca aphasia</strong> show the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nonfluent - Production of few words or difficulty producing words</li>
<li>Good comprehension</li>
<li>Loss of oral coordination</li>
<li>Possible face and arm hemiparesis (from damage to the adjacent motor cortex)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wernicke</h2>
<!-- Wernicke aphasia aka.. -->
<p>Wernicke’s aphasia is a <strong>receptive aphasia</strong>, which is a loss of the ability to understand language.</p>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>Wernicke’s aphasia results from damage to Wernicke’s area (language understanding area), which includes the following areas of the brain:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Posterior superior temporal gyrus</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inferior parietal lobe</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Patients with <strong>Wernicke’s aphasia</strong> show the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fluent speech</strong></li>
<li><strong>Poor comprehension</strong>, which presents as word substitutions, meaningless words, or meaningless phrases.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conductive</h2>
<!-- conductive aphasia aka, pathogenesis, symptoms.. -->
<p>Conduction aphasia, also known as <strong>associative aphasia</strong>, is a <strong>loss of the ability to tie in language production and language understanding.</strong></p>
<p>Conduction aphasia is the result of damage to the <strong>arcuate fasciculus</strong>, which connects Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas of the brain. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supramarginal gyrus</strong></li>
<li><strong>Angular Gyrus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Symptoms of patients with <strong>conduction aphasia</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fluent speech</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty in Repetition</strong></li>

</ul>
<h2>Global</h2>
<!-- global aphasia pathogenesis, symptoms.. -->
<p>Global aphasia is a <strong>complete loss of language expression, understanding, and association</strong>.</p>
<p>Global aphasia results from <strong>decreased blood flow through the middle cerebral artery</strong> (MCA), leading to massive <strong>infarcts of the left cerebral hemisphere</strong>, thereby damaging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broca’s area</li>
<li>Wernicke’s area</li>
<li>Arcuate fasciculus</li>
</ul>
<p>Symptoms of patients with global aphasia include:</p>

<h1>Stroke</h1>
<!--  2 types of stroke.. -->
<ul>
<li>2 types of strokes in general: ischemic, hemorrhagic</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/A4D8C40A-91F3-4FDA-971E-0834D5435140.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Ischemic</h2>
<!-- ischemic stroke pathogenesis, 3 types.. -->
<p>Ischemic stroke results when <strong>blood flow to the brain is limited, resulting in decreased oxygenation of brain parenchyma.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ischemic stroke or cerebrovascular accident</strong> (CVA) is the leading cause of neurologic disability and third leading cause of death.</p>
<p>**Thrombosis **and <strong>emboli</strong> are the two mechanisms by which an ischemic stroke can occur. Can also be <strong>lacunar.</strong></p>
<h3>Embolic</h3>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>Embolic stroke is the most common etiology of CVA, most commonly originating from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heart</strong></li>
<li><strong>Internal carotid artery</strong></li>
<li><strong>Aorta</strong></li>
<li>**Emboli that arise from blood clots in the peripheral veins.**These patients will also likely have a patent foramen ovale.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thrombotic</h3>
<p>Thrombotic strokes occur due to <strong>atherosclerotic lesions</strong> within the carotid artery or the arteries of the brain.</p>
<h3>Lacunar</h3>
<p>Another form of ischemic stroke is a Lacunar stroke. Lacunar stroke is a <strong>small vessel thrombotic disease with narrowing of the arterial lumen due to thickening of the vessel wall.</strong></p>
<p>Lacunar strokes are the cause of <strong>20%</strong> of all strokes.</p>
<p>Lacunar infarcts affect the <strong>subcortical structures</strong> supplied by small branches of the Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA), circle of Willis, basilar and vertebral arteries.</p>
<p>Patients who have lacunar strokes typically have a <strong>history of hypertension</strong>.</p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<!-- ischemic stroke risk factors, comorbidities.. -->
<p>Risk Factors for ischemic stroke include both lifestyle risk factors and comorbidities of the patient.</p>
<p>Life style risk factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smoking</strong></li>
<li><strong>Diet</strong></li>
<li><strong>Vasoconstrictive drug use</strong></li>
<li><strong>Oral contraceptive use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Comorbidities associated with stroke:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Previous stroke or family history of stroke</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hypercoagulability</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hypertension</strong></li>
<li>**Diabetes **</li>
<li><strong>Atrial Fibrillation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>###Symptoms</p>
<!-- embolic vs thrombotic symptoms.. -->
<p>Clinical features of CVA depend on the <strong>type of ischemic stroke</strong> and the <strong>location of the occlusion</strong>.</p>
<p>Embolic strokes are <strong>very rapid in onset</strong> and <strong>present with maximal deficits.</strong></p>
<p>Thrombotic strokes can be <strong>rapid or stepwise</strong> in onset and the <strong>patient typically awakens from sleep with the deficits</strong>.</p>
<p>Complications of ischemic stroke include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Progression of the neurologic deficits</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cerebral edema leading to mass effects</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hemorrhage</strong></li>
<li><strong>Seizures</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- ACA, MCA, PCA, vertebrobasilar, lacunar strokes symptoms.. -->
<p>Strokes that occur in the <strong>anterior cerebral artery (ACA)</strong> present with contralateral lower extremity motor and sensory deficiencies.</p>
<p>Strokes that occur in the <strong>middle cerebral artery</strong> present with contralateral hemiparesis (if proximal to small branch), hemisensory loss, aphasia, and apraxia. Symptoms are more common in the upper extremities than the lower extremities.</p>
<p>Strokes that occur in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) most commonly present with <strong>hemianopia</strong>. In addition, infarction of the left PCA may present with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alexia without agraphia</strong>: can write, can't read</li>
<li><strong>Anomic aphasia</strong>: word finding difficulty</li>
<li><strong>Gerstmann syndrome</strong>: agraphia, acalculia, finger agnosia</li>
</ul>
<p>And infarction of the right PCA may present with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prosopagnosia</strong>: can't recognize face</li>
<li><strong>Spatial disorientation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Visual neglect</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Strokes that occur within the <strong>vertebral or basilar arteries</strong> present with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ipsilateral ataxia</li>
<li>Ipsilateral diplopia</li>
<li>Ipsilateral dysphagia</li>
<li>Ipsilateral dysarthria</li>
<li>Vertigo</li>
</ul>
<p>Lacunar strokes typically present as <strong>pure motor or pure sensory deficits.</strong></p>
<h3>Management</h3>
<!-- ischemic stroke diagnosis and management.. -->
<p>Careful observation for stroke progression and cerebral edema in patients with acute stroke is indicated for <strong>24-36 hours.</strong> Patients should be monitored on a <strong>telemetry floor</strong>, and neurologic checks should be performed every 4 hours.</p>
<p>When diagnosing a CVA, a <strong>noncontrast CT</strong> scan is the <strong>first line imaging</strong> test to be ordered.</p>
<p><strong>An infarct will not appear on CT scan for 24-48 hours</strong>, but this test is important to rule out intracranial hemorrhage and to identify patients who will benefit from thrombolytic therapy.</p>
<p><strong>MRI</strong> of the brain is the <strong>most sensitive</strong> test to identify all early ischemic changes but is time consuming and should not be used in the acute setting.</p>
<p>Other important tests include</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Labs</strong> to assess CBC, cardiac enzymes, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, lipid profile, PTT, PT and INR.</li>
<li><strong>Carotid duplex</strong> to assess for stenosis</li>
<li><strong>ECG and echocardiogram</strong> to assess for atrial fibrillation or acute MI that may be a source of emboli</li>
<li><strong>Magnetic Resonance Arteriogram (MRA)</strong> to identify stenosis of vessels within the head and neck.</li>
<li><strong>Assessment of hypercoagulable states</strong> in those with a history of thombotic events</li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment of ischemic stroke typically includes the use of intravenous recombinant <strong>tissue plasminogen activator</strong> (tPA, also called <strong>alteplase</strong>) if the drug can be administered <strong>within 3-4.5 hours</strong> of the onset of symptoms, and there are no contraindications to its use.</p>
<p>Exclusion criteria for tPA include</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significant head trauma or intracranial surgery</strong></li>
<li><strong>Previous intracranial hemorrhage</strong></li>
<li><strong>Intracranial neoplasm or arterial malformation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Current anticoagulant use</strong></li>
<li><strong>Platelet count less than 100,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Uncontrolled hypertension</strong></li>
<li><strong>Age &gt;80</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do not give tPA if the time of the stroke is unknown</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If the patient cannot receive tPA, <strong>aspirin (160-325 mg/day) is best given within 24 hours</strong>. If a patient cannot take aspirin, clopidogrel should be used.</p>
<p>If the patient has received tPA, <strong>wait 24 hours</strong> before beginning an aspirin regimen.</p>
<p>In an ischemic stroke patient, it is important to allow for <strong>permissive hypertension</strong>. The increased blood pressure will help maintain perfusion of the ischemic tissue. However, if the patient has systolic BP &gt;220 mmHg or diastolic &gt;120 mmHg they should be treated with IV labetalol or nicardipine.</p>
<p>Carotid endarterectomy is indicated in <strong>symptomatic patients with ≥70% carotid artery stenosis</strong> or <strong>asymptomatic patients with ≥80% stenosis</strong>.</p>
<p>Other long term preventative measures for future ischemic stroke include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aspirin or clopidogrel use if stroke is secondary to small vessel disease or thrombosis</li>
<li>Anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation or hypercoagulable disorders</li>
<li>Management of comorbidities (e.g. hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hypertension)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Parenchymal Hemorrhage</h2>
<h3>Pathogenesis</h3>
<!-- intracerebral hemorrhage aka, pathogenesis, causes in different populations.. -->
<p>Parenchymal hemorrhage, also known as intracerebral hemorrhage, is <strong>bleeding within the brain tissue</strong>.</p>
<p>Parenchymal hemorrhage has multiple mechanisms that lead to brain injury, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct injury</strong> due to an expanding blood clot</li>
<li><strong>Mass effect</strong> leading to increased intracranial pressure</li>
<li><strong>Ischemic injury</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parenchymal hemorrhage</strong> is the second most common cause of stroke, second only to ischemic stroke in frequency.</p>
<p><strong>Small vessel vasculopathy secondary to chronic hypertension</strong> is the most common cause of parenchymal hemorrhage.  The underlying pathology is a combination of <strong>microatheroma</strong> formation and <strong>lipohyalinosis</strong> that ultimately leads to thrombotic small-vessel occlusion.</p>
<p><strong>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy</strong> is the most common cause of nontraumatic <strong>lobar</strong> parenchymal hemorrhage in elderly patients.</p>
<p><strong>Intracranial vascular anomalies</strong> (e.g. <strong>arteriovenous malformations</strong>) are the most common cause of parenchymal hemorrhage in children.</p>
<!-- children IVH risks.. -->
<p>Exposure to vascular perfusion injuries have also been associated with IVH.  Examples of such events are: (1) hypoxic or ischemic episodes, (2) hypotension, (3) reperfusion of damaged vessels, (4) increased venous pressure, and (5) abrupt changes in cerebral flow.</p>
<!-- ICH locations in HTN vs amyloid.. -->
<p>Parenchymal hemorrhages due to <em>hypertension</em> most commonly occur in the <strong>basal ganglia</strong> (especially the <strong>putamen</strong>), <strong>thalamus</strong>, and <strong>pons</strong>.</p>
<p>In contrast, parenchymal hemorrhages due to <em>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</em> most commonly occur in the <strong>parietal</strong> and <strong>occipital lobes</strong>.</p>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<!-- intracerebral hemorrhage symptoms, vs subarachnoid.. -->
<p>Patients with <strong>parenchymal hemorrhage</strong> present with focal neurologic symptoms (e.g. hemiplegia, homonymous hemianopsia) that are followed by manifestations of increased intracranial pressure (e.g. headache, vomiting). These manifestations intensify <em>gradually</em> over time.</p>
<p>In contrast, patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage present <em>abruptly</em> with an <em>intense</em> headache <em>without</em> focal neurologic symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Seizures</strong> can occur in the days following a parenchymal hemorrhage; this is especially common in patients with superficial (e.g. lobar) hemorrhages.</p>
<!-- basal ganglia, cerebellar, thalamus, cerebral lobe, pons hemorrhage symptoms.. -->
<p><img src="https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/L8773.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3>Cerebellar Symptoms</h3>
<!-- cerebellar IPH symptoms.. -->
<p>Typical features of cerebellar hemorrhage include <strong>occipital headache</strong> (may radiate to neck/shoulders), <strong>neck stiffness</strong> (due to extension of blood into the 4th ventricle), nausea/vomiting, and nystagmus.  Patients may also have <strong>ipsilateral hemiataxia</strong> of the trunk (cerebellar vermis) and/or limbs (cerebellar hemispheres) as the corticopontocerebellar fibers decussate twice.  Hemiparesis and sensory loss are usually absent, but extension of the bleed to the brainstem can cause cranial neuropathies (eg, <strong>ipsilateral facial nerve palsy</strong>).  Further hematoma expansion may lead to brainstem compression resulting in stupor, coma, and ultimately death.  Early diagnosis with <strong>noncontrast head CT scan</strong> is crucial as emergency decompression may be life-saving, especially if the hemorrhage is &gt;3 cm.</p>
<h3>Diagnosis and Management</h3>
<!-- ICH diagnosis and management.. -->
<p><strong>Noncontrast head CT scan</strong> is most widely used to diagnose parenchymal hemorrhage.</p>
<p><strong>Magnetic resonance angiography</strong> or <strong>CT angiography</strong> can be used to localize the site of bleeding.</p>
<p>MRI may be more useful in diagnosing <strong>micro hemorrhages</strong> within the brain parenchyma.</p>
<p>Treatment of parenchymal hemorrhage is supportive care. Focus is made on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintaining normal intracranial pressure</strong></li>
<li><strong>Maintaining normal blood pressure</strong></li>
<li><strong>Using anticonvulsants to control seizure activity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Surgical decompression for large hemorrhages</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Surgical repair of any <strong>arteriovenous malformations or aneurysms</strong> may be required.</p>
<h2>Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</h2>
<!-- subarachnoid hemorrhage pathogenesis, causes, risk factors.. -->
<p><strong>Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</strong> is a <strong>brain bleed that occurs below the arachnoid layer</strong> of the meninges and is most commonly due to the <strong>rupture of a berry aneurysm</strong>.</p>
<p>Other causes include <strong>trauma to the circle of Willis, or an arteriovenous malformation.</strong></p>
<p>Risk factors for subarachnoid hemorrhage include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hypertension</strong> (most common)</li>
<li><strong>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease</strong> (ADPKD)</li>
<li><strong>Bleeding disorders or use of a blood thinner</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</strong></li>
<li><strong>Smoking</strong> (most important preventable risk factor)</li>
</ul>
<!-- SAH locations.. -->
<p>Common sites for the occurrence of a subarachnoid hemorrhage include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Junction of the anterior communicating artery and anterior cerebral artery</strong></li>
<li><strong>Junction of the posterior communicating artery and the internal carotid artery</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<!-- SAH symptoms.. -->
<p>Many patients who have a <strong>subarachnoid hemorrhage</strong> will present with the sudden onset of a severely painful headache (“worst headache of my life”). <strong>Thunderclap headache</strong></p>
<p>The onset of the headache may or may not be associated with a <strong>brief loss of consciousness, nausea or vomiting, and meningismus.</strong></p>
<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
<!-- SAH diagnosis, management.. -->
<p>Diagnosis of a subarachnoid hemorrhage is made by a <strong>noncontrast CT scan</strong>.</p>
<p>A lumbar puncture is performed to diagnose subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) if there is a <strong>strong suspicion of SAH and the CT scan is negative</strong>. The <strong>presence of blood in the cerebrospinal fluid</strong> or <strong>xanthochromia</strong> (yellow tint of the cerebrospinal fluid) is indicative of SAH.</p>
<p>The patient must be assessed for <strong>papilledema</strong> before performing the lumbar puncture so as not to cause herniation. If papilledema is present, repeat the CT scan first.</p>
<p>Treatment of a subarachnoid hemorrhage is <strong>surgical clipping and coiling</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Cerebral angiogram</strong> is the gold standard test for determining the location of bleeding in patients with a SAH.</p>
<p>The patient must be medically managed to reduce the risk of rebleeding. This includes <strong>managing blood pressure, using anti-seizure medications to prevent seizures, and stool softeners or laxatives</strong> to prevent straining during bowel movement</p>
<p>Symptomatic vasospasm and cerebral infarction are important contributors to unfavorable outcomes after SAH. It typically begins after day three post hemorrhage, reaching a peak at days seven to eight. <strong>Nimodipine</strong> may mitigate this complication.</p>
<!-- SAH complications -->
<p><strong>Hyponatremia</strong> is a potential complication due to &quot;cerebral salt-wasting syndrome&quot; or SIADH.,</p>
<p><img src="https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/L13726.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h1>Transient Ischemic Attack</h1>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p><strong>Transient ischemic attack</strong> (TIA) is defined as an <strong>acute episode of neurologic dysfunction</strong> caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal <strong>ischemia, without acute infarction</strong>. A TIA becomes an ischemic stroke only when infarction of CNS tissue occurs, and not necessarily a time course of greater than 24 hours.</p>
<p>Transient ischemic attack is caused by a <strong>temporary disruption of blood supply to the brain</strong> from underlying conditions such as aortic stenosis, vascular spasm, atherosclerosis, and emboli (the same conditions that cause strokes).</p>
<p>Risk factors for a TIA include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Age over 55 years</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hypertension</strong></li>
<li><strong>Diabetes mellitus</strong></li>
<li><strong>Coronary artery disease</strong></li>
<li><strong>Smoking</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hyperlipidemia</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hypercoagulable states</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Having a TIA puts a patient at risk for <strong>experiencing a stroke in the future.</strong></p>
<p>Symptoms of a TIA present very much like that of a stroke, with a <strong>patient experiencing weakness, paralysis, numbness, loss of coordination, vision abnormalities, slurred speech, and mental confusion.</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms appear suddenly, but <strong>typically abate within one day</strong>, with many cases resolving within an hour.</p>
<!-- TIA PE.. -->
<p>Physical exam may reveal <strong>carotid bruits or harsh systolic murmurs</strong> indicative of carotid atherosclerosis and aortic stenosis respectively. Physical exam may also reveal an <strong>irregularly irregular rhythm</strong> that is indicative of atrial fibrillation.</p>
<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>Diagnosis can be based on a thorough <strong>history and physical exam accompanied by CT or MRI findings.</strong> MRI is more likely to identify infarction of tissue.</p>
<p>Ultrasound can be useful for determining <strong>possible sources of atherosclerosis.</strong></p>
<p>Echocardiography can be useful to determine <strong>heart defects as an underlying cause of emboli</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), carotid duplex ultrasonography (CDUS), and transcranial doppler ultrasonography (TCD)</strong> can be used to identify if there is an obstructive lesion in a larger artery supplying the CNS.</p>
<p>Treatment consists of <strong>addressing the underlying conditions</strong> leading to ischemia**.**</p>
<p>Patients with TIA due to atherosclerosis should be given <strong>antiplatelet</strong> (e.g. <strong>aspirin</strong> or <strong>clopidogrel</strong>) and<strong>statin therapy.</strong></p>
<p>Patients with TIA due to severe carotid stenosis (i.e. 70 to 99% occlusion, symptomatic disease) should undergo <strong>carotid endarterectomy</strong> to increase blood flow to the brain.</p>
<p>Patients with TIA due to aortic stenosis should be offered <strong>beta blockers, valvuloplasty or valve replacement</strong>.</p>
