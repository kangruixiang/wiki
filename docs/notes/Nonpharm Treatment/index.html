<!-- motivational therapy is, use.. -->
<p>Motivational therapy is a form of therapy that attempts to motivate change in patients, attempting to make them care about their problem by <strong>addressing their denial or ambivalence</strong>.</p>
<p>Motivational therapy has particular utility in <strong>patients suffering from substance abuse</strong>.</p>
<h1>Family Therapy</h1>
<!-- family therapy is, use.. -->
<p>**Family therapy **focuses on reducing conflict between family members, by helping them understand and accomodate one another.</p>
<p>Patients with anorexia nervosa may benefit from family therapy, as their feelings of inadequacy tied to their weight may be rooted in maladaptive parental dynamics (e.g. unreasonable expectations, excessive criticism).</p>
<h1>Psychoanalysis</h1>
<!-- psychoanalysis is, different parts, uses.. -->
<p><strong>Psychoanalysis</strong> seeks to resolve conflicts of the unconscious mind by providing an environment in which unconscious conflicts can be reconciled by the conscious mind. It is a subset of psychotherapy. There are three important types of psychoanalysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Psychodynamic psychoanalysis</li>
<li>Interpersonal psychoanalysis</li>
<li>Supportive psychoanalysis</li>
</ul>
<p>Psychodynamic psychoanalysis <strong>explores past events</strong> and utilizes <strong>transference</strong> to help patients solve problems that may be due to unresolved trauma. It is best used in <strong>everyday, high-functioning people,</strong> who may have a history of bereavement, rape, or other emotional trauma.</p>
<p>Interpersonal psychoanalysis helps patients improve interpersonal communication to <strong>resolve relationship problems</strong>.</p>
<p>Supportive psychoanalysis helps patients <strong>feel safe and cope</strong> during an acute crisis or other difficult time. It is the treatment of choice for <strong>adjustment disorder</strong>.</p>
<h2>Transference and Counter</h2>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>Transference occurs when <strong>subconscious feelings regarding close, influential people in a patient's life are experienced in the present relationship with the therapist and are analyzed</strong>. Essentially, the therapist emulates such figures in the person's life.</p>
<p>Countertransference occurs when <strong>the therapist unconsciously re-experiences feelings about important persons in his/her life with the patient</strong>. It is essentially the transference in the opposite direction.</p>
<h1>Behavioral Therapy</h1>
<h2>Operant Conditioning</h2>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>Reinforcement theory (operant conditioning) includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive reinforcement</li>
<li>Negative reinforcement</li>
<li>Punishment</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Don't confuse punishment with negative reinforcement!</em> Punishment is the addition of a negative stimulus to <strong>discourage</strong> an action, while negative reinforcement is the subtraction of a negative stimulus to <strong>encourage</strong> an action.</p>
<p><strong>Positive reinforcement</strong> is giving a reward for a correct behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Giving a child a cookie for completing her homework.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Negative reinforcement</strong> is a reward that comes in the form of removal/prevention of a negative event. Subjects learn to perform actions that prevent adverse situations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: A man living with chronic joint pain takes medication that relieves his pain.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Punishment</strong> is a negative stimulus that discourages an unwanted action.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Being charged with a jail sentence for a crime.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Classical conditioning</h2>
<p><strong>Classical conditioning</strong>, as opposed to operant conditioning, is a simple behavioral association of a stimulus with a response by linking two simultaneously experienced stimuli. The stimulus is paired with an existing stimulus frequently and consistently, such that the new stimulus will begin to evoke a similar behavioral response to the one the existing stimulus had.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Pavlov's classic experiment, where dogs were conditioned to salivate when hearing a bell. The existing stimulus-behavior pair was that of food with salivation; the dogs began to associate the bell with food after the bell always rang when food arrived.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deconditioning</h2>
<!-- deconditioning examples.. -->
<p>Behavioral therapy utilizes various strategies to decondition a patient, allowing them to unpair a pathological response for a given stimulus. There are multiple strategies that can be used in this type of therapy:</p>
<ul>
<li>systematic</li>
<li>flooding</li>
<li>Aversion</li>
<li>Token economy</li>
<li>Biofeedback</li>
</ul>
<p>Systematic desensitization is the <strong>gradual exposure to a fear-provoking stimulus</strong>,<strong>typically increasing in intensity in a step-wise fashion</strong>. It is commonly used to treat <strong>phobias</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: A man with a fear of snakes is first shown a picture of a snake, then is given a snake toy to hold, then is shown a documentary on snakes, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flooding is <strong>sudden</strong>, <strong>full exposure to the fear-producing stimulus</strong>, until the patient adjusts to his/her fear. It is commonly used to treat <strong>phobias</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: A man who is afraid of heights goes on a high-altitude hiking trip.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aversion therapy <strong>pairs a negative stimulus to a behavior the therapist is seeking to modulate</strong>. Often used to treat <strong>addiction</strong> and <strong>paraphilias</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: An alcoholic woman taking disulfiram experiences nausea and emesis when drinking alcohol.</li>
</ul>
<p>Token economy refers to <strong>using positive reinforcement to incentivize certain behaviors</strong>. It has particular utility in <strong>highly disorganized</strong> (e.g. <strong>schizophrenic</strong>) or <strong>mentally incapacitated patients</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: A patient receives &quot;privilege tokens&quot; for showering, shaving, brushing teeth, etc. that can be redeemed for time watching TV.</li>
</ul>
<p>Biofeedback is the <strong>process of mentally controlling physiologic parameters</strong>. It has particular utility in psychiatric conditions where <strong>physical symptoms</strong> are prominent, allowing the patient to gain better mental control of these symptoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: A woman with panic attacks tracks her heart rate during episodes to attempt to mentally alleviate her tachycardia.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Cognitive Therapy</h1>
<h2>CBT</h2>
<!-- CBT is, use.. -->
<p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a combination of behavioral therapy and cognitive therapy (focused on correcting maladaptive thought patterns). The patient learns how one's behavior is influenced by one's thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>learn what emotions feeling right now</li>
<li>what thoughts are leading to that emotion</li>
<li>what are some distortions causes those thoughts (making up stories in head)</li>
</ul>
<p>CBT has particular utility in correcting <strong>destructive thought patterns</strong>, such as inadequacy, depression, and other self-defeating thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>CBT</strong> may be one of the most common answer choices for non-pharmacological therapy on the Psych shelf and Step 2, due to its widespread applicability. When in doubt, choose it over other types.</p>
<h2>DBT</h2>
<!-- DBT is, use.. -->
<p>Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) is a form of therapy used to <strong>prevent self-injury</strong> and to encourage patients to be more adaptive to stressors and change.</p>
<p>Dialectical behavioral therapy has particular utility in <strong>borderline personality disorder.</strong></p>
