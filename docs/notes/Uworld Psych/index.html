<!-- help rejecters are, management.. -->
<p>They believe that no treatment will help and appear to not want to improve.  These patients are frustrating and can leave the physician feeling angry and manipulated.  The understandable tendency to want to refer this patient to another provider or specialist should be avoided.</p>
<p>These patients often have underlying depression but will refuse referral to a psychiatrist.  They are needy for attention and unconsciously wish to remain symptomatic so that they can continue to see a physician.  The best approach is to <strong>empathize</strong> with these patients and <strong>attempt to engage</strong> them in a <strong>collaborative plan</strong> in which there is mutual agreement about realistic treatment approaches and <strong>limited expectations</strong>.  Sharing frustration over disappointing outcomes and focusing on alleviation of symptoms rather than a cure is often helpful.</p>
<h2 id="alcohol" tabindex="-1">Alcohol</h2>
<!-- A 55-year-old woman comes to the office due to insomnia and fatigue that began a year ago after her youngest child left for college.  The patient used to sleep 7-8 hours without difficulty.  Over the past year, she started drinking wine before bedtime to relax.  She then wakes up around 3:00 AM.  The patient's symptoms have become progressively worse, and she now lies in bed awake for several hours in the middle of the night, thinking and worrying about her children.  She reports mild difficulty with concentration and no change in appetite.  The patient experiences occasional brief sadness due to missing her children.  She does not consider herself a generally anxious person.  She has a history of hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine and gastroesophageal reflux disease diagnosed 3 months ago and treated with ranitidine.  Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 12/min.  Physical examination shows a mild tremor but no other abnormalities.  Laboratory results show increased AST.. -->
<p>The incidental findings of <strong>abnormal liver enzymes</strong> and <strong>macrocytosis</strong> in this patient suggest that her symptoms are most likely due to <strong>alcohol use</strong>.  This patient's history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, and tremor on examination are also consistent with this clinical picture.  She does not have significant depressive symptoms or a history of anxiety suggestive of a primary psychiatric disorder.  As in this case, patients with chronic alcohol use frequently present in primary care with sleep disturbance and anxiety symptoms due to mild withdrawal.  Patients may use alcohol to help fall asleep, but as the blood alcohol level drops, central nervous system hyperarousal occurs and results in awakenings.  Many patients with chronic alcohol use develop persistent difficulties in both falling and staying asleep.</p>
<p>Several biomarkers used in screening for unhealthy alcohol use include an <strong>aspartate aminotransferase:alanine aminotransferase ratio</strong> of at least <strong>2:1</strong>, elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, macrocytosis, pancytopenia, and increased carbohydrate-deficient transferrin.</p>
<p>This patient's alcohol use might have started as an adjustment reaction to her children leaving home.  However, her persistent symptoms and abnormal laboratory findings suggest that chronic alcohol dependence has developed and is causing her current insomnia and anxiety.  It is also important to note that adjustment disorders should not be diagnosed when criteria are met for another specific disorder.</p>
<h2 id="suicide" tabindex="-1">Suicide</h2>
<!--  He is seriously considering hanging himself with rope his father keeps in the garage.  He has not spoken to anyone else about his suicidal thoughts and does not know if he will act on them.. -->
<p>This patient is severely depressed and has <strong>active suicidal ideation</strong> with a plan to hang himself.  He has access to lethal means and unclear ability to refrain from acting on suicidal thoughts.  Due to his high risk of self-harm, <strong>confidentiality</strong> should be <strong>broken</strong> and the parents informed.  The patient should be <strong>hospitalized</strong> immediately (on an involuntarily basis if necessary) so that he can be closely monitored and placed on suicide precautions if needed.</p>
<p>Parents of adolescent patients should always be notified when the patient is a risk to self or others or when starting psychotropic medication.  <strong>If this patient is not suicidal and simply wants to discuss his depression or obtain psychotherapy referrals, his request for confidentiality should be respected.</strong></p>
<h2 id="delusions" tabindex="-1">Delusions</h2>
<!-- psychotic patient delusions physician response.. -->
<p>The best approach to the <strong>psychotic patient with no insight</strong> is a nonjudgmental stance that <strong>acknowledges</strong> the <strong>patient's experience</strong> and perspective <strong>without endorsing specific delusions</strong> or hallucinations.  After a physician-patient relationship is established and the patient's psychosis begins to improve, it may be appropriate to assist the patient in distinguishing psychotic thoughts from reality.</p>
<h2 id="normal-aging" tabindex="-1">normal aging</h2>
<!-- normal aging vs mild neurocognitive disorder.. -->
<p>Normal age-related changes, as seen in this patient, should <strong>not impair daily functioning</strong> (eg, self-care, finances, medication management).  This helps distinguish normal aging from mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD).  In mild NCD, there is a modest but notable decline in cognitive function (eg, complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, social cognition).  Capacity for independence in everyday activities is generally preserved but takes greater effort, time, and/or compensatory strategies.  Major NCD (dementia) involves significant cognitive decline and clearly impaired functioning that necessitates assistance in everyday activities.</p>
<h2 id="normal-stress-response-vs-adjustment" tabindex="-1">Normal Stress Response vs Adjustment</h2>
<!-- normal stress response vs adjustment disorder with depressed mood.. -->
<ul>
<li>normal stress response: pt exhibits <strong>no impairment of social and occupational functioning</strong></li>
<li>Adjustment with depressed mood: depressive symptoms develop within 3 months of the onset of an identifiable stressor and cause <strong>marked distress out of proportion to the stressor</strong>, but the full criteria for major depressive disorder are not met.  Adjustment disorder requires that symptoms cause <strong>clear impairment in social and occupational functioning</strong>, which this patient does not demonstrate (still performs at work, enjoys socializing).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="psychosis-hospitalization" tabindex="-1">Psychosis Hospitalization</h2>
<!-- when to hospitalize psychotic patient.. -->
<p>The legal standards specifying the criteria for civil commitment vary by state, but they generally require the presence of a mental illness, <strong>danger to self or others</strong>, and/or <strong>grave disability</strong> (<strong>inability to care for self</strong> due to mental illness).</p>
<h2 id="admit-vs-hold-in-er" tabindex="-1">Admit vs Hold in ER</h2>
<!-- admit patient vs hold patient in ER.. -->
<ul>
<li>Holding patients overnight is reasonable in situations in which they will likely be better able to communicate the next day (eg, no longer intoxicated with alcohol or drugs)</li>
<li>Admit patient if their treatment plan is unlikely to change acutely (suicidal)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="smoking-cessation" tabindex="-1">Smoking Cessation</h2>
<!-- smoking cessation 3 FDA approved 1st line therapies.. -->
<p><strong>Nicotine replacement therapy</strong> (NRT, patch, gum), <strong>varenicline</strong>, and <strong>bupropion.</strong></p>
<h2 id="otc-med-psychosis" tabindex="-1">OTC med psychosis</h2>
<!-- A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents due to fever, runny nose, cough, and unusual behavior. Parents gave him OTC cold medicine.. -->
<p>This previously well child has been receiving medication for his cough and cold for the past 36 hours, and his<strong>acute onset</strong> of <strong>hallucinations</strong> is most likely due to a medication <strong>side effect</strong>.  Many <strong>over-the-counter cold preparations</strong> contain antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine, doxylamine) that decrease nasal discharge but also have anticholinergic properties that can cause confusion and hallucinations.</p>
<h2 id="antisocial-vs-narcissitic" tabindex="-1">Antisocial vs Narcissitic</h2>
<!-- antisocial vs narcissistic personality similary/differences.. -->
<ul>
<li>both:  exaggerated sense of self importance and lack empathy  (eg, thinks ordinary work is beneath him, quits job without realistic plans for getting another)</li>
<li>difference: antisocial has more aggression, physical violence</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="therapies" tabindex="-1">Therapies</h2>
<p><img src="https://photos.thisispiggy.com/file/wikiFiles/L16100.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="fund-of-knowledge" tabindex="-1">Fund of Knowledge</h2>
<!-- fund of knowledge is -->
<p>asking question average adult would know.,</p>
<h2 id="concrete-thinking" tabindex="-1">Concrete Thinking</h2>
<!-- concrete thinking is.. -->
<p>Patients who present with concrete thinking have lost the ability to form abstract concepts, such as metaphors, and focus instead on actual things and facts. Concrete thinking is the norm in children and is seen in cognitive disorders (mental retardation, dementia) and schizophrenia.</p>
