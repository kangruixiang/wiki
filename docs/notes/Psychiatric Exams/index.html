<article><h1>Psychiatric Exams</h1>
<!-- MMSE is, assesses, grading.. -->
<p>The Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) is a frequently-used test to assess gross cognitive functioning. The areas of cognitive function it evaluates include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orientation (person, place, time)</li>
<li>Memory (immediate registry, recent recall)</li>
<li>Concentration and attention (serial 7’s or spell “world” backwards)</li>
<li>Language (naming, repetition, comprehension)</li>
<li>Reading/writing</li>
<li>Visuospatial ability (copy a design)</li>
</ul>
<p>The MMSE is graded out of 30 points, with <strong>&gt;25</strong> indicating intact cognition.</p>
<h1>Diagnositic Testing</h1>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<!-- personality testings.. -->
<p>Personality testing can be objective or projective:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Objective:</em> <strong>Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory</strong> (MMPI-2)</li>
<li><em>Projective:</em> <strong>Thematic Apperception Test</strong> (TAT) and <strong>Rorschach Test</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Thematic Apperception Test</strong> involves asking the patient to create stories based on pictures of people in various situations.</p>
<p>The <strong>Rorschach Test</strong> involves interpretation of inkblots to identify themes in perception that give insight to personality.</p>
<h2>Intelligence</h2>
<!-- intelligence tests scoring, adults, kids. Mental retardation score.. -->
<p>Intelligence testing results in an IQ score, which has a mean of <strong>100</strong> and a standard deviation of <strong>15</strong>.</p>
<p>The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) is the most commonly used IQ test for <strong>adults</strong>.</p>
<p>The Stanford-Binet Test is used in <strong>children and adolescents</strong>.</p>
<p>Mental retardation is typically diagnosed at <strong>IQ &lt; 70.</strong>  As of DSM-V, mental retardation is no longer stratified in severity according to IQ scores.</p>
<h2>Depression</h2>
<!-- depression test.. -->
<p><strong>Beck's Inventory</strong> is used to measure the severity of a patient's depression. For patients 13 and above.</p>
<h2>Brain lesions</h2>
<!-- brain lesion psychic test.. -->
<p>The Halstead-Reitan battery is used <strong>to identify and localize brain lesions</strong>.</p>
<h1>Others</h1>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p><strong>Mood</strong> refers to how the patient is <em>feeling</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: A patient reports feeling sad (a depressed mood).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Affect</strong> refers to how the patient <em>expresses</em> his/her feelings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: A patient recalls tragic events without emotion (a flat affect).</li>
</ul>
<!-- tangentiality vs circumstantiality.. -->
<p><em>Tangentiality</em> refers to a thought process that escapes onto a tangent, and <strong>never returns to the intended end point</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: &quot;I was feeling suicidal because last time I went to my friend's house, which is back by this really cool place I used to hang out by as a kid, where I used to.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Circumstantiality</em> refers to a thought process that includes numerous unnecessary side-comments and information, but eventually <strong>returns to the intended point</strong> (high-yield!).</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: &quot;The voices are worse when I either use cocaine, which I get from my dealer, who is really good at chess and random things like, or when I use heroin.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<!-- ideas of reference is.. -->
<p><strong>Ideas of reference</strong>: Belief that some general event is uniquely related to the patient.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: The patient believes the radio is talking to him/her.</li>
</ul>
<!-- thought broadcasting is.. -->
<p><strong>​Thought broadcasting</strong>: Belief that one's thoughts can be heard by others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: The patient is paranoid that someone will not like them because of negative thoughts they had about that person.</li>
</ul>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p><strong>Illusions</strong> are inaccurate perceptions of <em>real</em> stimuli.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Mistaking a man for one's dead husband.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hallucinations</strong> are perceptions that occur <em>in absence of</em> any real stimulus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Hearing a man's voice in an empty room.</li>
</ul>
<!-- narcolepsy hallucinations.. -->
<p>Hypnagogic (immediately before falling sleep) and hypnopompic (before waking up) hallucinations can occur with <strong>narcolepsy</strong>, though they may also occur in patients without the disorder.</p>
<!-- visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile hallucinations ddx.. -->
<p>Visual hallucinations are common in <strong>delirium</strong>, <strong>alcohol withdrawal</strong>, and <strong>drug intoxication</strong>. Many other miscellaneous causes may be responsible as well, including <strong>Lewy body dementia</strong>.</p>
<p>Auditory hallucinations are common in <strong>schizophrenia</strong>. Command hallucinations are auditory hallucinations that specifically tell the individual to perform certain actions.</p>
<p>Olfactory hallucinations (those of smells) often occur as an aura of psychomotor <strong>epilepsy</strong> or as the result of a <strong>brain tumor</strong>.</p>
<p>Tactile hallucinations (those of touch) can occur in patients with <strong>delirium tremens</strong> from alcohol withdrawal and <strong>cocaine use</strong>. An example of a common tactile hallucination is formication, the sensation of ants crawling on one's skin.</p>
