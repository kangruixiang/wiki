<article><h1>Legal Psychiatry</h1>
<!-- What is decision making ability. Why is it important. Pts with mental disorders have decision making ability?.. -->
<p>Decision-making ability must be assessed for a patient to be able to give informed consent. Decision-making ability typically requires that a patient understand the information, be aware of the alternatives and consequences, then effectively communicate their decision.</p>
<p>Note: Patients with mental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc.) should be <strong>assumed to have decision-making ability</strong> unless actively displaying psychiatric dysfunction! A schizophrenic well-controlled on medication can give informed consent until assessed otherwise.</p>
<!-- competency vs capacity.. -->
<p>Competence is a <strong>legal</strong> term typically assessed by a judge. It refers to a patient's ability to enter legal contracts, and its lack thereof questions the validity of such contracts.</p>
<p>Capacity is assessed in a clinical setting (a common psych consult). It refers to a patient's ability to make informed <strong>medical</strong> decisions.</p>
<p>Competence and capacity are <strong>situation-dependent</strong>. Depending on the gravity of decisions and their consequences, the same patient may or may not have decision-making capacity.</p>
<p>This is exemplified by a suicidal patient being able to sign themselves into a hospital (a low-risk, low-consequence scenario), but not to sign themselves out (high-risk).</p>
<!-- minors can consent when.. -->
<p>Minors follow parental input/consent unless they are emancipated by one of the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Financial independence</strong></li>
<li><strong>Military service</strong></li>
<li><strong>Marriage</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have children</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1>Legal</h1>
<!-- Legal insanity is.. -->
<p><strong>Legal insanity</strong> applies to a patient's inability to understand and be responsible of a crime they committed due to mental illness. It absolves the patient, to varying degrees, of criminal responsibility for a crime. It is not usually successful (about a <strong>2.5% success rate</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>The duty to protect principle</strong> (also known as the Tarasoff case) refers to a principle of forensic psychiatry that states that <strong>medical professionals can break patient confidentiality to protect involved parties from harm from dangerous patients</strong>.</p>
<p>Depending on state-specific laws, this principle may be mandatory, permissive (confidentiality breaching is permissible but not negligent if foregone), or a law regarding the principle may not exist at all.</p>
