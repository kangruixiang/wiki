<article><h1>Substance Abuse</h1>
<!-- sedative/hypnotic general management.. -->
<p>The most important concern in sedative-hypnotic (alcohol, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates) intoxication is <strong>maintenance of the airway.</strong></p>
<p>The most important concern in sedative-hypnotic withdrawal is <strong>seizure prevention.</strong></p>
<h2>Alcohol</h2>
<!-- alcohol intoxication symptoms.. -->
<p>Signs of alcohol intoxication include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sedation</li>
<li><strong>Ataxia</strong></li>
<li>Emotional lability</li>
<li><strong>Slurred speech</strong></li>
<li>Disinhibition</li>
<li><strong>Nystagmus</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- alcohol intoxication vs hypomania.. -->
<p>It is important to note that the disinhibition of alcohol intoxication can resemble hypomania/mania. Suspect alcohol intoxication in a patient with hypomanic symptoms, ataxia, normal pupillary findings, and normal BP.</p>
<p>Signs of alcohol withdrawal include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tremulousness</li>
<li>Tachycardia, hypertension</li>
<li>Seizures</li>
<li>Delirium tremens (DTs)</li>
<li>Agitation</li>
<li>Hallucinations</li>
</ul>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>The first and most common sign of alcohol withdrawal is <strong>tremulousness</strong>.</p>
<h3>Alcholic Hallucinosis</h3>
<!-- alcoholic hallucinosis is, symptoms, time.. -->
<p><strong>Alcoholic hallucinosis</strong> is a type of alcohol withdrawal syndrome characterized by an <strong>alert sensorium</strong>, predominantly visual <strong>hallucinations</strong> (although auditory and tactile hallucinations also occur) and relatively <strong>stable vital signs</strong>.  It <strong>develops 12-24</strong> hours after the last drink and usually <strong>resolves</strong> within <strong>24-48 hours</strong>.</p>
<h2>Benzodiazepines</h2>
<!-- benzodiazepines vs alcohol vs opioid intoxication.. -->
<p>Benzodiazepine use may resemble that of alcohol or barbiturates, which is likely due to their common action of agonizing GABA receptors. The presence of <strong>nystagmus</strong> is indicative of <strong>alcohol</strong> intoxication, rather than benzodiazepine intoxication.</p>
<p>Benzodiazepines intoxication can be differentiated from opioid intoxication by the presence of a <strong>lesser degree of respiratory depression</strong> and <strong>normal pupils</strong> in benzodiazepine use.</p>
<p>Additional information specific to benzodiazepines may be found on the benzodiazepine card.</p>
<h2>Opioid</h2>
<!-- opioid.. -->
<p>Opioid intoxication causes the triad of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CNS depression</strong></li>
<li><strong>Respiratory depression</strong></li>
<li><strong>Miosis</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A relatively specific sign of opioid intoxication is **significant respiratory depression **(4-6 respirations/min). Pupils may not always be miotic in opioid intoxication due to ingestion of multiple illicit drugs or severe cerebral hypoxia from apnea.</p>
<p>While benzodiazepines and barbiturates can also cause respiratory depression, the prevalence of opioid use and the degree of depression it causes warrants a high clinical suspicion of opioids.</p>
<p><strong>Opioid withdrawal</strong> is not life-threatening, but quite unpleasant. Signs and symptoms peak after 24-48 hrs. of onset and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restlessness, yawning</li>
<li>Rhinorrhea, lacrimation</li>
<li>Myalgias, arthralgias</li>
<li>Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea</li>
<li>Sweating, piloerection</li>
<li>Dilated pupils</li>
</ul>
<h3>Meperidine</h3>
<!-- meperidine toxicity symptoms -->
<p>Is the only opioid that does not cause miosis.,</p>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>Opioid overdose is treated with <strong>naloxone</strong>, a short-acting opioid antagonist.</p>
<p>Patients that present with acute opioid withdrawal that is precipitated by an interruption in opioid use can be treated with <strong>methadone</strong>.</p>
<h2>Cannabis/THC - Marijuana</h2>
<!-- marijuana toxicity -->
<p>Often associated with <strong>injected conjunctiva</strong>. Associated symptoms include euphoria, impaired judgement, increased appetite, and <strong>dry mouth</strong>.,</p>
<h1>Stimulants/Hallucinogen</h1>
<!-- stimulant, hallucinogen management.. -->
<p>Emergent management of acute intoxication with both stimulants and hallucinogens centers around control of agitation. The first line medication choice is parenteral <strong>benzodiazepines</strong>. If inadequate sedation is achieved, antipsychotics may also be used.</p>
<p>Hyperthermia in the setting of intoxication arises from excessive muscle activity. Supportive measures such as IV fluids and cooling blankets should be used when necessary, and muscle paralysis with <strong>non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers (e.g. rocuronium)</strong> can be added as well.</p>
<p>Notably, <em>succinylcholine is contraindicated</em> due to the risk of rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia.</p>
<p>Succinylcholine depolarizes AchR, causing Na influx and K efflux. When muscle no longer able to fire, K+ efflux continues, causing hyperkalemia. Rhabdomyolysis also contriutes to hyperkalemia.</p>
<h2>Amphetamine</h2>
<!-- stimulants intoxication symptoms, diagnosis.. -->
<p><strong>Amphetamine/cocaine</strong> intoxication is characterized by euphoria and grandiosity resembling <strong>mania or psychosis</strong>. The following signs are present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tachycardia</li>
<li>Hypertension</li>
<li>Pupillary dilation</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Insomnia</li>
<li>Psychomotor agitation</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals often use cocaine in binges, taking the drug repeatedly over a short period to maintain their &quot;high.&quot;  Following abrupt cessation, a &quot;crash&quot; typically occurs.  This initial period can include severe depression with suicidal ideation and psychomotor slowing with milder symptoms that resolve within 1-2 weeks.</p>
<p>Heavy use frequently causes marked weight loss, psychotic symptoms, and <strong>excoriations</strong> due to chronic <strong>skin picking</strong>.  Severe dental problems (&quot;meth mouth&quot;) can include brown discoloration, tooth decay, and cracked teeth due to severe clenching.</p>
<p>The diagnostic hallmark in this scenario is <strong>erythema of the turbinates and nasal septum</strong>, which is a common finding in individuals who snort cocaine.  In severe cases, perforation of the nasal septum can occur.</p>
<p>Chronic use can cause tooth decay.</p>
<!-- stimulant use withdrawal symptoms.. -->
<p>Amphetamine/cocaine withdrawal is <em>not life-threatening</em>, as opposed to that of sedative-hypnotics. It is characterized by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Depression/suicidality</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hypersomnolence</strong></li>
<li><strong>Increased appetite</strong></li>
<li><strong>Psychomotor retardation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Intense drug craving</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- stimulant use death from.. -->
<p>Acute complications of stimulant use are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Myocardial infarction</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stroke</strong></li>
<li><strong>Arrhythmia</strong></li>
<li><strong>Seizure</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- cocaine use vs bulimia vs avoidant food intake disorder.. -->
<ul>
<li>All have decreased appetite</li>
<li>Diagnosis of bulimia nervosa requires evidence of binge eating and compensatory behaviors</li>
<li>Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder involves lack of interest and avoidance of eating based on the sensory characteristics of food, with typical onset in <strong>infancy or early childhood</strong>. Cocaine use in adolescent</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ecstasy</h2>
<!-- MDMA aka, is, symptoms -->
<p>Ecstasy is an amphetamine with hallucinogenic properties that is popular in dance parties (&quot;raves&quot;). Sequelae of intoxication include <strong>hyponatremia</strong> (seizures, altered mental status), <strong>heat exhaustion</strong> (hyperthermia), and <strong>serotonin syndrome</strong> (myoclonus). Other signs of amphetamine intoxication are possible as well.,</p>
<h2>Inhalant</h2>
<!-- Common inhalants.. --> 
<p>Commonly abused substances include glue, nitric oxide (&quot;whippets&quot;), toluene, and spray paints.</p>
<p>Inhalants may be abused by sniffing, huffing (inhaled from a saturated cloth), or bagging (bag over mouth or nose) to concentrate the inhaled substance.</p>
<!-- inhalants demographics, symptoms, labs.. -->
<p>Signs of acute intoxication may include brief transient <strong>euphoria</strong> and <strong>loss of consciousness</strong> and vary depending on the specific chemicals inhaled.  Inhalants are highly lipid soluble and produce <strong>immediate effects that typically last 15-45 minutes</strong>.  They act as central nervous system depressants and may cause death.</p>
<p><strong>Dermatitis (glue sniffer's rash)</strong> due to chemical exposure can be seen around the mouth or nostrils.  Inhalants are rapidly eliminated and are <strong>not included in most routine hospital toxicology screens</strong>.  <strong>Liver function tests</strong> may be elevated with repeated use.  <strong>Boys age 14-17</strong> are at highest risk for inhalant abuse, which may go unnoticed because common household products are used and no drug paraphernalia is found.</p>
<h2>Nicotine</h2>
<!-- nicotine withdrawal symptoms -->
<p>Withdrawal causes <strong>irritability</strong>, <strong>headache</strong>, and <strong>increased appetite</strong>.,</p>
<!-- negative drug screen cannot rule out.. -->
<p>Due to pharmacokinetics and chemical composition of the substances, certain <strong>hallucinogens</strong> (inhalants, mescaline, LSD) cannot reliably be detected on urine drug screen. <em>Therefore, hallucinogen intoxication cannot be ruled out with a negative drug screen!</em></p>
<h2>LSD</h2>
<!-- LSD is, symptoms -->
<p>Hallucinogen characterized by perceptual distortion and subjectively intensified experiences. Patients may experience flashback hallucinations later in life after use.,</p>
<h2>PCP</h2>
<!-- Phencyclidine, PCP, aka, is, symptoms -->
<p><strong>Angel dust</strong> is a hallucinogenic drug of abuse. The two features most suggestive of intoxication are <strong>nystagmus</strong> (rotatory, or simultaneous horizontal and vertical nystagmus, is highly indicative) and <strong>violence</strong>.,</p>
<h1>Alcoholism</h1>
<!-- wernicke-korsakoff symptoms, diagnosis, treatment.. -->
<p>Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is caused by <strong>vitamin B1 (thiamine)</strong> **deficiency **secondary to alcoholism.</p>
<p>Wernicke encephalopathy is a triad of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confusion</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ophthalmoplegia</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ataxia</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Untreated Wernicke encephalopathy can progress to Korsakoff syndrome, which is characterized by <strong>anterograde and retrograde amnesia</strong> as well as <strong>confabulation</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Mamillary body atrophy</strong> on MRI is specific for chronic Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome.</p>
<p>Wernicke encephalopathy is treated with <strong>IV thiamine</strong>.</p>
<p>Administration of glucose in patients at risk for thiamine deficiency should be preceded or accompanied by <strong>thiamine</strong> since Wernicke encephalopathy can be precipitated by glucose administration.</p>
<h2>Delirium tremens</h2>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p><strong>Delirium tremens</strong> is a life-threatening alcohol withdrawal syndrome which peaks 2-5 days after the last drink. It is characterized by delirium, hyperthermia, tachycardia, and seizures.</p>
<p><strong>Alcoholic hallucinosis</strong> is a syndrome of alcohol withdrawal characterized by the onset of hallucinations (usually visual) <strong>within 12-48 hours of abstinence</strong> that <strong>resolve within 24 to 48 hours</strong>. In contrast to delirium tremens, patients experiencing alcoholic hallucinosis have <strong>stable vital signs</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Mallory-Weiss syndrome</strong> is characterized by longitudinal mucosal lacerations at the gastroesophageal junction caused by excessive vomiting. It presents as painful hematemesis in an alcoholic.</p>
<p><strong>Esophageal varices</strong> are complications of portal hypertension that can also be a cause of bleeding in the setting of alcoholism. They present as painless hematemesis in an alcoholic.</p>
<p>Reference the following topics for further medical and pathological discussion of alcoholism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liver Disease: Alcohol and Drugs</li>
<li>Pancreatitis: Acute</li>
<li>Pancreatitis: Chronic</li>
</ul>
<h1>Gambling</h1>
<!-- pathologic gambling is, treatment.. -->
<p><strong>Gambling disorder</strong>, previously known as pathologic gambling, is defined as persistent and maladaptive gambling behavior that results in impairment or distress.  The diagnosis is based on 4 or more of the following characteristics within the past 12 months: gambling when distressed, depressed or anxious; increased gambling to achieve the desired excitement; frequently returning to gambling to recover past losses; <strong>preoccupation with gambling</strong>; irritability and distress when trying to cut back on gambling; <strong>repeated unsuccessful attempts to cut back</strong>; trying to conceal the extent of behaviors; <strong>jeopardizing relationships</strong> or <strong>employment</strong>; and relying on others to make up for financial losses.  The behavioral symptoms of gambling disorder appear to have commonalities with substance-related disorders (eg, anticipatory craving, chronic relapsing course).</p>
<p><strong>Gamblers Anonymous</strong> is the most effective treatment. Comorbid conditions such as mood disorders or anxiety can be treated symptomatically.</p>
<h1>Substance Use</h1>
<!-- what is substance use disorder, characteristics, labs, disease association.. -->
<p>The DSM-5 has integrated the DSM-IV categories of “substance abuse” and “substance dependence” disorders into one disorder called “<strong>substance use disorder</strong>.” The DSM-5 recognizes substance use disorders resulting from ten separate classes of drugs (i.e. tobacco use disorder, alcohol use disorder etc.), which all exhibit psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial complications to some extent.</p>
<p>Patients with <strong>substance use disorder</strong> exhibit some of the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social or occupational dysfunction due to substance use</li>
<li>Inability to cut down</li>
<li>Spending significant time getting, using, or recovering from the use of the substance</li>
<li>Tolerance</li>
<li>Withdrawal</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Always consider substance abuse in a child/adolescent with a relatively sudden change in behavior!</p>
<p>Lab findings that may suggest a substance use disorder include <strong>elevated</strong> <strong>mean corpuscular volume</strong> (alcohol), <strong>elevated liver enzymes</strong> (alcohol, hepatitis from re-using needles), and <strong>positive serology for hepatitis B or C</strong>.</p>
<h2>Alcohol</h2>
<!-- alcohol use lab.. -->
<p>Serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) is a sensitive indicator of use.</p>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>Blood, breath, hair, saliva and sweat can all be tested for the presence of drugs of abuse. <strong>Urine testing</strong> is the most widely used because it is noninvasive.</p>
<!-- alcohol treatment, treatment CI.. -->
<p><strong>Naltrexone</strong> is a <strong>first-line treatment</strong> of <strong>alcohol use disorder</strong> that has been shown to <strong>decrease alcohol craving</strong>, reduce heavy drinking days (defined as &gt;5 drinks for men and &gt;4 for women), and increase days of abstinence.  It can be initiated while the patient is still drinking.  Naltrexone acts as a mu-opioid receptor antagonist and decreases the reinforcing effects of alcohol use.  It is <strong>contraindicated in patients taking opioids and those with acute hepatitis or liver failure</strong>.  It can be used in mild liver dysfunction, as in this patient, to prevent worsening damage from chronic alcohol use.</p>
<p>Acamprosate, a glutamate modulator, is another first-line medication for alcohol dependence.  It is initiated once <strong>abstinence</strong> is achieved and is used to maintain abstinence rather than to reduce drinking in nonabstinent patients.  Naltrexone would be preferred in this patient who is actively drinking.</p>
<p><strong>Disulfiram</strong> inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and is used as an aversive agent that discourages drinking by causing an <strong>unpleasant physiologic reaction</strong> when alcohol is consumed.  Candidates for disulfiram <strong>must be abstinent</strong> and <strong>highly motivated</strong>.</p>
<p>Non-pharmacological treatments such as <strong>Alcoholics Anonymous</strong> are helpful to many patients.</p>
<!-- ignore.. -->
<p>The most effective pharmacological treatment for tobacco use disorder is <strong>varenicline</strong>. Other pharmacological treatment options include bupropion and nicotine (gum, patches, etc.).</p>
<!-- opioid use disorder treatment.. -->
<p>Pharmacological treatment for opioid use disorder may involve <strong>methadone</strong>, <strong>buprenorphine</strong>, and <strong>naltrexone</strong>. Psychotherapy has a role as well.</p>
<h1>Stages of Change</h1>
<!-- 5 stages of changes are.. -->
<p>The &quot;stages of change model&quot; for behavioral change is a popular model for how health behavior change (including recovery from substance use) takes place.</p>
<p>It consists of five stages, the first being <strong>Pre-contemplation</strong>: not yet acknowledging that there is a problem.</p>
<p>The second stage is **Contemplation: **acknowledging the problem, but not yet ready or willing to change it.</p>
<p>The third stage is **Preparation: **preparing to change the behavior.</p>
<p>The fourth stage is <strong>Action:</strong> changing the behavior.</p>
<p>The fifth stage is <strong>Maintenance:</strong> maintaining the behavior change.</p>
<p>In addition to the five stages, patients may also experience <strong>termination</strong> (patients have no temptation and are sure they will not return to the behavior) or **relapse **(return from action or maintenance stages to an earlier stage).</p>
